I, like many people, already used a [[citation manager]] to keep track of citations and integrate with [[Latex]]. But what if I want to include citations as part of my workflow in [[Obsidian]]?

Originally, I did not know about [[Zotero]] and decided to manually move all the pdfs into a folder in my [[Obsidian]] vault and create a note for each one, e.g. [[Bale2019]].

So, to avoid you having to go through this pain, we will use the [[Obsidian - Citations]] plugin to integrate with [[Zotero]]. This will:
1. Allow you to create literature notes automatically
	1. With a consitent citation key format across [[Obsidian]] and [[Zotero]]
2. Have links to take you to the original paper and the [[Zotero]] item
3. Allow you to create links between notes and ideas inside [[Obsidian]], yet still retain the pdf handling of [[Zotero]]
