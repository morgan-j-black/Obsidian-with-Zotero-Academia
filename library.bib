Lizard assemblages on loams associated with creek lines differed from those on the sands of the Abydos Plain and those adjacent to rocky substrates.

Concurrently, social systems, composed of human communities that have direct cultural connections to local ecology and place, may draw upon environmental research as a component of knowledge. Such research can corroborate local and traditional ecological knowledge and empower its application. Indigenous communities and their interactions with and management of resources in their traditional territories can provide a model of such social-ecological systems. As decision-making agency is shifted increasingly to indigenous governments in Canada, abundant opportunities exist for applied ecological research at the community level. Despite this opportunity, however, current approaches by scholars to community engaged ecological research often lack a coherent framework that fosters a respectful relationship between research teams and communities. Crafted with input from applied scholars and leaders within indigenous communities in coastal British Columbia, we present here reflections on our process of academic\textendash community engagement in three indigenous territories in coastal British Columbia, Canada. Recognizing that contexts differ among communities, we emerge with a generalizable framework to guide future efforts. Such an approach can yield effective research outcomes and emergent, reciprocal benefits such as trust, respect, and capacity among all, which help to maintain enduring relationships. Facing the present challenge of community engagement head-on by collaborative approaches can lead to effective knowledge production toward conservation, resource management, and scholarship.},

We found higher small-scale spatial heterogeneity on the natural reef compared with the study breakwater. Species richness and diversity were associated with a higher availability of crevices, rock pools and mussels in natural habitats. Spatial distribution of certain grazers corresponded well with the spatial structure of microhabitats. In contrast, the lack of microhabitats on the breakwater resulted in the absence of several grazers reflected in lower species richness. Biogenic and topographic microhabitats can have interactive effects providing niche opportunities for multiple species, explaining differences in species diversity between artificial versus natural reefs.},

Here, we provide evidence that urban artificial reefs have a high potential to accumulate the diverse forms of litter originating from anthropogenic activities around cities. We test the hypothesis that the structural complexity of urban breakwaters, when compared with adjacent natural rocky intertidal habitats, is a driver of anthropogenic litter accumulation. We determined litter abundances at seven sites (cities) and estimated the structural complexity in both urban breakwaters and adjacent natural habitats from northern to central Chile, spanning a latitudinal gradient of \textasciitilde 15  (18 S to 33 S). Anthropogenic litter density was significantly higher in coastal breakwaters when compared to natural habitats (\textasciitilde 15.1 items m\`A2 on artificial reefs versus 7.4 items m\`A2 in natural habitats) at all study sites, a pattern that was temporally persistent. Different litter categories were more abundant on the artificial reefs than in natural habitats, with local human population density and breakwater extension contributing to increase the probabilities of litter occurrence by \textasciitilde 10\%. In addition, structural complexity was about two-fold higher on artificial reefs, with anthropogenic litter density being highest at intermediate levels of structural complexity. Therefore, the spatial structure characteristic of artificial reefs seems to enhance anthropogenic litter accumulation, also leading to higher residence time and degradation potential. Our study highlights the interaction between coastal urban habitat modification by establishment of artificial reefs, and pollution. This emergent phenomenon is an important issue to be considered in future management plans and the engineering of coastal ecosystems.},

Few attempts have been made to link community changes to the rhythmic behavior of individuals within populations. Cabled video observatories can be used to explore community changes over different temporal windows as a result of the activity rhythms of individuals within populations. In this study, we used, for the first time, a coastal cabled observatory (OBSEA) to video monitor activity rhythms of different fish species within an artificial reef area at a high frequency. During 1 mo, 30 min daily count patterns were continuously measured and compared with the corresponding solar irradiance. A significant (p {$<$} 0.05) day-night patterning was observed in the majority of recognized taxa by Chi-Square periodogram analysis. Three types of rhythms were identified in waveform plotting: (1) diurnal (Chromis chromis, Coris julis, Diplodus annularis, D. cervinus, D. sargus, D. vulgaris, Serranus cabrilla, Dentex dentex, Symphodus sp.); (2) nocturnal (Atherina sp. and Scorpaena sp.); and (3) crepuscular (Apogon imberbis, Oblada melanura, and Spicara maena). Diurnal species clustered around maximum averaged irradiance (computed from a cosinor analysis). The results were discussed evaluating whether visual count time series represent a reliable proxy for the swimming activity rhythms of individuals and whether the complex habitat use of coastal fishes would require the use of spatial networks of cameras.},

Massbalance and dynamic ecosystem simulation models (Ecopath with Ecosim: E w E ) are developed to represent the marine system o f northern British Columbia as it appeared in 1750, 1900, 1950 and 2000 A D . Time series statistics are assembled for biomass and catch, incorporating local ecological knowledge ( L E K ) from community interviews and new estimates o f illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishery catch. The dynamic behaviour o f the historic models is fitted to agree with this time series information, when driven by historic catch rates and climate anomalies. Each historic period is evaluated in an optimal policy analysis for its potential to supply sustainable harvest benefits. Harvest benefits are quantified using socioeconomic and ecological indicators, including novel measures such as the Q-90 biodiversity statistic. Candidate goals for restoration are drafted based on these historic ecosystems. A new conceptual goal for ecosystem-based restoration is introduced, the optimal restorable biomass ( O R B ) that represents an optimized form o f the historic ecosystems. It is structured to maximize sustainable harvest benefits, and to achieve a compromise between exploitation and the maintenance o f historic abundance and biodiversity. Finally, restoration plans are drafted using a novel addition to Ecosim's policy search routine, the specific biomass objective function, which determines the pattern of fishing effort required to restore the depleted present-day ecosystem into one resembling a more productive O R B state. Cost-benefit analysis indicates that northern B C ecosystem restoration to an O R B state based on the 1950 ecosystem can deliver a rate o f economic return, in terms o f increased fisheries yields, that is superior to bank interest. The effect o f fleet structure is paramount; reducing bycatch w i l l greatly enhance the effectiveness o f the fleet as a restoration tool.

Time series data are compiled for catch, fishing mortality and biomass using fisheries statistics and literature values. Using the assembled dataset, dynamics of the 1950-based simulations are fitted to agree with observations over 50 years to 2000 through the manipulation of trophic flow parameters and the addition of climate factors: a primary production anomaly and herring recruitment anomaly. The predicted climate anomalies reflect documented environmental series, most strongly sea surface temperature and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation index. The best-fit predator\textendash prey interaction parameters indicate mixed trophic control of the ecosystem. Trophic flow parameters from the fitted 1950 model are transferred to the other historical periods assuming stationarity in density-dependent foraging tactics. The 1900 model exhibited an improved fit to data using this approach, which suggests that the pattern of trophic control may have remained constant over much of the last century. The 1950 model is driven forward 50 years using climate and historical fishing drivers. The resulting ecosystem is compared to the 2000 model, and the dynamics of these models are compared in a predictive forecast to 2050. The models suggest similar restoration trajectories after a hypothetical release from fishing.},

We used a standardized method to represent climate effects that relied on time-series forcing functions: annual multipliers of species productivity. We focused on changes in fisheries landings, biomass, and ecosystem characteristics (diversity and trophic indices). Fisheries landings generally declined in response to cumulative effects and often to a greater degree than would have been predicted based on individual climate effects, indicating possible synergies. Total biomass of fished and unfished functional groups displayed a decline, though unfished groups were affected less negatively. Some functional groups (e.g. pelagic and demersal invertebrates) were predicted to respond favourably under cumulative effects in some regions. The challenge of predicting climate change impacts must be met if we are to adapt and manage rapidly changing marine ecosystems in the 21st century.},

  abstract = {Structurally complex habitats are becoming rarer across temperate marine environments; indeed the coastal and marine world is getting flatter. In some cases marine habitats are lost entirely (e.g., wetlands are filled), but in many cases the loss is a gradual transition from a more complex to a less complex habitat (i.e., a change from canopy-forming to turf forming algae). We explore the multiple ways habitat loss affects marine species diversity, and propose a conceptual model that identifies the main interactions and feedbacks between these processes. The loss of habitat structure generally leads to lower abundances (biomasses) and often to declines in species richness. There is often also a suite of colonizing species that prosper from these transitions. These sets of expanding species can amplify the changes to the system, cause variable effects on species richness and other components of diversity, feed back to affect the various components of habitat loss (e.g. maintain new environmental conditions) and prevent the recovery of the system. Less well studied are the effects on between-habitat ({$\beta$}) diversity and functional diversity. We argue that we need to understand these latter changes to better manage and conserve the structure and function of ecosystems and the diverse services that humans continue to expect from them. Calling for more of the approaches and thinking that John Gray championed we discuss how this work can focus efforts in research, conservation, restoration and management.},

The isotopic analysis showed that the dogs' dietary protein was derived almost exclusively from marine sources. Lower Columbia River ethnohistoric accounts and Cathlapotle zooarchaeological records indicate that while marine fish were dietary keystones, the local diet was more diverse, and included terrestrial organisms and freshwater fishes. This apparent discrepancy raises the possibility the dogs were selectively fed. Thus their diet may not be a close proxy for human diet in this context.},

In this respect, many different methods have been adopted for the analysis of fish stomach contents. No consensus has, however, been reached for a standardised methodology despite that for several decades there has been an ongoing debate about which methodical approaches that should be preferred. Here, we critically review and scrutinise methods, addressing their strengths and weaknesses and emphasising inherent problems and possible pitfalls in their use. Although our critical assessment reveals that no completely ideal approach exists, appropriate and reliable procedures can be adopted through careful considerations and implementation. In particular, we advocate that different objectives require different methodical approaches and the choice of method should therefore be closely linked to the research questions that are addressed. For a standardisation of methods, we recommend a combination of the relative-fullness and presence\textendash absence methods as the optimal approach for the commonly applied feeding studies addressing relative dietary composition in terms of prey diversity and abundance. Additionally, we recommend the gravimetric method for objectives related to the quantification of food consumption rates and the numerical method for prey selection studies. DNA-based dietary analysis provides a new and promising complementary approach to visual examination of stomach contents, although some technical challenges still exist. The suggested method standardisation facilitates comparisons across species, ecosystems and time and will enhance the applicability and benefits of fish feeding studies in trophic ecology research.},

We derive the abundance of species as a function of their asymptotic size. The derivation is based on size-spectrum theory, where population structure is derived from physiology and simple arguments regarding the predator-prey interaction. Using a hypothesis of constant satiation, which states that the average degree of satiation is independent of the size of an organism, the number of individuals with a given size is found to be proportional to the weight raised to the power Ϫ2.05, independent of the predator/prey size ratio. This is the first time the spectrum exponent has been derived solely on the basis of processes at the individual level. The theory furthermore predicts that the parameters in the von Bertalanffy growth function are related as K {$\propto$} LϪ{$\varrho$}1.},

Immunostimulants and adjuvants can be administered before, with, or after vaccines to amplify the specific immune response generating elevations of circulating antibody titers and numbers of plaque-forming cells. Special applications of immunostimulants include assisting shower or other regimens to increase topical uptake of vaccines. In addition, immunostimulants may be used alone, inducing elevated activities in the nonspecific defense mechanisms such as increased oxidative activity of neutrophils, augmented engulfment activity of phagocytic cells, or potentiating cytotoxic cells. In cases where disease outbreaks are cyclical and can be predicted, losses may be reduced by elevating the nonspecific defense mechanisms, and the immunostimulants may be used in anticipation of events to prevent losses from diseases. Complete Freund's adjuvant was one of the first immunostimulants used in animals to elevate the specific immune response, and it has also been successfully used in conjunction with injection of fish bacterins. Other adjuvants, immunostimulants, and biological response modifiers that have been used in fisheries research include levamisole, salt baths, and bacterial lipopolysaccharides.},

Analysis of variance is particularly powerful for the analysis of univariate data. The traditional multivariate analogues, however, are too stringent in their assumptions for most ecological multivariate data sets. Non-parametric methods, based on permutation tests, are preferable. This paper describes a new non-parametric method for multivariate analysis of variance, after McArdle and Anderson (in press). It is given here, with several applications in ecology, to provide an alternative and perhaps more intuitive formulation for ANOVA (based on sums of squared distances) to complement the description provided by McArdle and Anderson (in press) for the analysis of any linear model. It is an improvement on previous non-parametric methods because it allows a direct additive partitioning of variation for complex models. It does this while maintaining the flexibility and lack of formal assumptions of other non-parametric methods. The teststatistic is a multivariate analogue to Fisher's F-ratio and is calculated directly from any symmetric distance or dissimilarity matrix. P-values are then obtained using permutations. Some examples of the method are given for tests involving several factors, including factorial and hierarchical (nested) designs and tests of interactions.},

Called ``CAP'' for ``Canonical Analysis of Principal coordinates,'' this method will allow a constrained ordination to be done on the basis of any distance or dissimilarity measure. We describe CAP in detail, including how it can uncover patterns that are masked in an unconstrained MDS ordination. Canonical tests using permutations are also given, and we show how the method can be used (1) to place a new observation into the canonical space using only interpoint dissimilarities, (2) to classify observations and obtain misclassification or residual errors, and (3) to correlate the original variables with patterns on canonical plots. Misclassification error or residual error is used to obtain a non-arbitrary decision concerning the appropriate dimensionality of the response data cloud (number of PCO axes) for the ensuing canonical analysis. We suggest that a CAP ordination and an unconstrained ordination, such as MDS, together will provide important information for meaningful multivariate analyses of ecological data by reference to explicit a priori hypotheses.},

The asymptotic distributions of these statistics under permutations of the observations are shown to be invariant to changes in the distributions of the original variables, unlike the distributions of the multi-response permutation test statistics which have been considered by other workers for testing differences among groups. This canonical method is applied to multivariate fish assemblage data, with Monte Carlo simulations to make power comparisons and to compare theoretical results and empirical distributions.

The potential impact of sedimentation on benthic infauna was quantitatively investigated in the Okura estuary, which is at the northern fringes of urban development in Auckland, New Zealand. A structured mensurative sampling programme, measuring benthic infauna and various environmental variables, is described. Of the variance in macrofaunal assemblages from 15 sites throughout the Okura estuary on 6 sampling occasions, 70\% was explained by environmental variables. Proportions of ambient sediment grain-sizes, depositional categories from previous models, the amount and characteristics of trapped sediments, organic content, changes in bed height and distance from the mouth of the estuary were all useful in explaining variation in macrofaunal assemblages. Levels of sedimentation recorded in this study were sub-catastrophic ({$<$} 3 cm of deposition d\textendash 1), corresponding to natural fluctuations in sedimentation. Bivalves generally had a negative relationship with sedimentation, while certain burrowing crabs and polychaetes were more abundant in high-deposition environments. The total amount and the grain-size characteristics of trapped sediments explained a significant proportion of the variation in soft-sediment assemblages, over and above the variation explained by ambient sediment variables. Thus, sedimentation appears to be an important structuring force in these intertidal estuarine macrobenthic assemblages.},

The choice of transformation and dissimilarity measure has important consequences for interpreting results. For kelp holdfast assemblages from New Zealand, variation in species composition was greater in smaller holdfasts, while variation in relative abundances was greater in larger holdasts. Variation in community structure of Norwegian continental shelf macrobenthic fauna increased with increases in environmental heterogeneity, regardless of the measure used.

Here, we report the results of the first simulation study, to our knowledge, specifically designed to examine the effects of heterogeneity of multivariate dispersions on the rejection rates of these tests and on a classical MANOVA test (Pillai's trace). Increasing differences in dispersion among groups were simulated under scenarios of changing sample sizes, correlation structures, error distributions, numbers of variables, and numbers of groups for balanced and unbalanced one-way designs. The power of these tests to detect environmental impacts or natural large-scale biogeographic gradients was also compared empirically under simulations based on parameters derived from real ecological data sets. Overall, ANOSIM and the Mantel test were very sensitive to heterogeneity in dispersions, with ANOSIM generally being more sensitive than the Mantel test. In contrast, PERMANOVA and Pillai's trace were largely unaffected by heterogeneity for balanced designs. PERMANOVA was also unaffected by differences in correlation structure, unlike Pillai's trace. For unbalanced designs, however, all of the tests were (1) too liberal when the smaller group had greater dispersion and (2) overly conservative when the larger group had greater dispersion, especially ANOSIM and the Mantel test. For simulations based on real ecological data sets, PERMANOVA was generally, but not always, more powerful than the others to detect changes in community structure, and the Mantel test was usually more powerful than ANOSIM. Both the error distributions and the resemblance measure affected results concerning power. Differences in the underlying construction of these test statistics result in important differences in the nature of the null hypothesis they are testing, their sensitivity to heterogeneity, and their power to detect important changes in ecological communities. For balanced designs, PERMANOVA and PERMDISP can be used to rigorously identify location vs. dispersion effects, respectively, in the space of the chosen resemblance measure. ANOSIM and the Mantel test can be used as more ``omnibus'' tests, being sensitive to differences in location, dispersion or correlation structure among groups. Unfortunately, none of the tests (PERMANOVA, Mantel, or ANOSIM) behaved reliably for unbalanced designs in the face of heterogeneity.},

  abstract = {We describe a new pathway for multivariate analysis of data consisting of counts of species abundances that includes two key components: copulas, to provide a flexible joint model of individual species, and dissimilarity-based methods, to integrate information across species and provide a holistic view of the community. Individual species are characterized using suitable (marginal) statistical distributions, with the mean, the degree of over-dispersion, and/or zero-inflation being allowed to vary among a priori groups of sampling units. Associations among species are then modeled using copulas, which allow any pair of disparate types of variables to be coupled through their cumulative distribution function, while maintaining entirely the separate individual marginal distributions appropriate for each species. A Gaussian copula smoothly captures changes in an index of association that excludes joint absences in the space of the original species variables. A permutation-based filter with exact family-wise error can optionally be used a priori to reduce the dimensionality of the copula estimation problem. We describe in detail a Monte Carlo expectation maximization algorithm for efficient estimation of the copula correlation matrix with discrete marginal distributions (counts). The resulting fully parameterized copula models can be used to simulate realistic ecological community data under fully specified null or alternative hypotheses. Distributions of community centroids derived from simulated data can then be visualized in ordinations of ecologically meaningful dissimilarity spaces. Multinomial mixtures of data drawn from copula models also yield smooth power curves in dissimilarity-based settings. Our proposed analysis pathway provides new opportunities to combine model-based approaches with dissimilaritybased methods to enhance understanding of ecological systems. We demonstrate implementation of the pathway through an ecological example, where associations among fish species were found to increase after the establishment of a marine reserve.},

We seeded solute-permeable dialysis bags with water containing indigenous eDNA and suspended them in a large tank containing seawater. Bags were subjected to two treatments: half the bags were suspended near the water surface where they received high doses of sunlight, and half at depth where they received lower doses of sunlight. Bags were destructively sampled over the course of 87 hours. eDNA was extracted from water samples and used as template for a Scomber japonicus qPCR assay and a marine fish-specific 12S rRNA PCR assay. The latter was subsequently sequenced using a metabarcoding approach. S. japonicus eDNA, as measured by qPCR, exhibited first order decay with a rate constant \textasciitilde 0.01 hr -1 with no difference in decay rate constants between the two experimental treatments. eDNA metabarcoding identified 190 organizational taxonomic units (OTUs) assigned to varying taxonomic ranks. There was no difference in marine fish communities as measured by eDNA metabarcoding between the two experimental treatments, but there was an effect of time. Given the differences in UVA and UVB fluence received by the two experimental treatments, we conclude that sunlight is not the main driver of fish eDNA decay in the experiments. However, there are clearly temporal effects that need to be considered when interpreting information obtained using eDNA approaches.},

  abstract = {A series of local factors such as substrate structure, presence or absence of kelp forests and environmental variables play an important role in determining both the diversity and abundance of temperate reef fish assemblages. The presence of kelp forests has been shown to increase structural complexity, available shelter, and prey availability in the reef environment. This, in turn, may affect the structural organization of the fish assemblage. In this study, the diversity, abundance and trophic patterns of subtidal fish assemblages at 2 localities off the northern Chilean coast were analyzed. These localities differ markedly in their spatial structure: the subtidal substratum at Caleta Err\'azuriz is characterized by a sloping bedrock with large rocks and boulders and a kelp forest, while at Carrizal Bajo it consists of a sharply declining bedrock with few boulders and isolated kelp stands. We hypothesized that structurally highly complex habitats would exhibit higher diversity, abundance and a more complex trophic organization in terms of more functional groups and guilds of reef fish assemblages than less structured environments. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found similar species diversity and fish abundance at both localities. However, there were clear differences in species dominance, number of functional groups and trophic guilds. There were also marked differences in the trophic webs between localities. In the presence of kelp forest, both carnivores and omnivores consumed mainly benthic prey inhabiting the understory canopy, while in its absence carnivores fed on pelagic prey in the water column. Therefore, a more complex spatial structure would seem to support a more complex trophic organization with a greater degree of connectivity, as well as interaction between the species in a reef fish assemblage.},

Every component has its own inherent protective value, and the final combination of them is likely to be related to an animal's immunological history and evolutionary development. Vertebrate immune system consists of both systemic and mucosal immune compartments, but it is the mucosal immune system which protects the body from the first encounter of pathogens. According to anatomical location, the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, in teleost fish is subdivided into gut-, skin-, and gill-associated lymphoid tissue and most available studies focus on gut. The purpose of this paper is to summarise the current knowledge of the immunological defences present in skin mucosa as a very important part of the fish immune system, serving as an anatomical and physiological barrier against external hazards. Interest in defence mechanism of fish arises from a need to develop health management tools to support a growing finfish aquaculture industry, while at the same time addressing questions concerning origins and evolution of immunity in vertebrates. Increased knowledge of fish mucosal immune system will facilitate the development of novel vaccination strategies in fish.},

There are risks associated with any intervention and it is suggested that all stockings undergo risk screening in order to identify the high risk areas. The main concern regarding stocking relates to the impact on the genetic fitness of the wild population, and proposals to minimise the impact while still maintaining a fishery are made. To ensure that the greatest benefit from a stocking programme is realised, stocking rates should be optimal for the type of habitat being stocked. How this can be determined is presented together with guidelines for stocking different types of habitat. Benefit, in terms of cost of adult return or per adult fish caught, enables comparisons to be made with other management options. Information on survival rates of wild and hatchery-reared fish, unit cost of production and the economic value of fish and fishing is summarised enabling simple estimates of cost: benefit to be determined.},

This fitness decline can occur very quickly, sometimes following only one or two generations of captive rearing. In this review, we summarize existing data on the fitness of hatchery fish in the wild, and we investigate the conditions under which rapid fitness declines can occur. The summary of studies to date suggests: nonlocal hatchery stocks consistently reproduce very poorly in the wild; hatchery stocks that use wild, local fish for captive propagation generally perform better than nonlocal stocks, but often worse than wild fish. However, the data above are from a limited number of studies and species, and more studies are needed before one can generalize further. We used a simple quantitative genetic model to evaluate whether domestication selection is a sufficient explanation for some observed rapid fitness declines. We show that if selection acts on a single trait, such rapid effects can be explained only when selection is very strong, both in captivity and in the wild, and when the heritability of the trait under selection is high. If selection acts on multiple traits throughout the life cycle, rapid fitness declines are plausible.},

Such models are ,2 DAIC units because the penalty for one additional parameter is +2 AIC units, but model deviance is not reduced by an amount sufficient to overcome the 2unit penalty and, hence, the additional parameter provides no net reduction in AIC. Simply put, the uninformative parameter does not explain enough variation to justify its inclusion in the model and it should not be interpreted as having any ecological effect. Models with uninformative parameters are frequently presented as being competitive in the Journal of Wildlife Management, including 72\% of all AIC-based papers in 2008, and authors and readers need to be more aware of this problem and take appropriate steps to eliminate misinterpretation. I reviewed 5 potential solutions to this problem: 1) report all models but ignore or dismiss those with uninformative parameters, 2) use model averaging to ameliorate the effect of uninformative parameters, 3) use 95\% confidence intervals to identify uninformative parameters, 4) perform all-possible subsets regression and use weight-of-evidence approaches to discriminate useful from uninformative parameters, or 5) adopt a methodological approach that allows models containing uninformative parameters to be culled from reported model sets. The first approach is preferable for small sets of a priori models, whereas the last 2 approaches should be used for large model sets or exploratory modeling.},

  abstract = {Human-induced changes to habitats can have deleterious effects on many species that occupy them. However, some species can adapt and even benefit from such modifications. Artificial reefs have long been used to provide habitat for invertebrate communities and promote local fish populations. With the increasing demand for energy resources within ocean systems, there has been an expansion of infrastructure in near-shore benthic environments which function as de facto artificial reefs. Little is known of their use by marine mammals. In this study, the influence of anthropogenic sea floor structures (pipelines, cable routes, wells and shipwrecks) on the foraging locations of 36 adult female Australian fur seals (Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus) was investigated. For 9 (25\%) of the individuals, distance to anthropogenic sea floor structures was the most important factor in determining the location of intensive foraging activity. Whereas the influence of anthropogenic sea floor structures on foraging locations was not related to age and mass, it was positively related to flipper length/standard length (a factor which can affect manoeuvrability). A total of 26 (72\%) individuals tracked with GPS were recorded spending time in the vicinity of structures (from {$<$}1\% to {$>$}75\% of the foraging trip duration) with pipelines and cable routes being the most frequented. No relationships were found between the amount of time spent frequenting anthropogenic structures and individual characteristics. More than a third (35\%) of animals foraging near anthropogenic sea floor structures visited more than one type of structure. These results further highlight potentially beneficial ecological outcomes of marine industrial development.},

We tested the hypotheses that a macroalgal canopy would develop and barnacle cover would decrease in exclusion quadrats. Spatial replication considered localities and sites within localities, while temporal replication considered 2 seasons of removal and 2 start dates within each locality and season. The experimental methods included exclusion quadrats (using fences), procedural controls (half fences) and untouched controls. Results supported both hypotheses. Limpet removal caused exclusion quadrats to change over time more than controls. An algal canopy dominated by Fucus vesiculosus developed and more barnacles were lost in exclusion quadrats than in controls. In addition, more trochids (largely Gibbula spp.) and whelks (Thais lapillus) were found in exclusion quadrats. Site effects were significant for virtually all variables analysed but no effect of locality, season or date was found. An indirect effect mediated by the development of an algal canopy appeared to be responsible for the loss of barnacles in exclusion quadrats. This indirect effect might have been reinforced by an additional indirect effect of algae mediated by increased densities of whelks under the algal canopy. Altogether, our results agree with those in semi-exposed shores in other parts of the world but not with results obtained in the west coast of Sweden, which has contrasting environmental conditions and a different dominant grazer species.},

However, these tools have inherent sources of bias and the SCUBA divers who perform them are highly constrained in terms of survey time, maximum depth and frequency of sampling. Alternatives like underwater video are thus being recommended in a wide range of configurations. Yet, all these techniques are still limited in field of view, particularly when compared to the ability of a SCUBA diver performing censuses. In this scope, we evaluated the potential of an underwater wide-angle camera (UWC) to survey fish assemblages by testing it against instantaneous underwater visual census (UVC). Our results showed minimal yet significant differences between methods, mainly because of the camera's loss of resolution when under extreme visibility conditions. Both approaches had the same consistency and ability to detect changes in fish assemblages but, to estimate total species richness, the UWC needed less field effort. Moreover, a SCUBA diver performing census had an effect on fish assemblages which introduced differences of greater magnitude than those found between methods. The removal of the diver effect, the proven ability to detect changes in fish assemblages and the verified gain in field effort, pointed the wide-angle camera as a promising tool to perform census of reef fishes.},

Progress in MPA designation is slow, partially due to objections to MPA establishment by local stakeholders and Indigenous peoples.

The re-introduction of clam gardens into Gulf Islands National Park Reserve (GINPR) is used as an example of this approach. Clam gardens were constructed by First Nations on the Pacific Coast to augment the productivity of clam growth. Several former clam gardens are within GINPR. The primary mandate of national parks is to protect ecological integrity, potentially forbidding the re-introduction of clam gardens. The literature suggests that there would be minimal ecological impacts at the park level from the re-introduction of clam gardens. There could also be significant advantages both for conservation and First Nations communities. With a greater degree of decision-making input and the opportunity to re-introduce cultural practices, a values-based paradigm may contribute to the acceptability of coastal PAs and promote the expansion of conservation values in the landscape.},

Opposition by First Nations is a factor as these protected areas have the potential to impact on Aboriginal rights. This case study with the Hul'qumi'num First Nations examines their approaches to marine conservation and their perspectives on ``no-take zones'' as a component of marine conservation. The study used a variety of community engagement procedures including relationship building, hiring of a Hul'qumi'num research assistant, conducting individual interviews, focus groups, and field surveys. Interviews were conducted with 41 participants contacted because of their knowledge and interest in marine resource use. The views reported provide a rich understanding of Hul'qumi'num attitudes, but cannot be generalised to the whole population. There was widespread support for efforts to involve local First Nations communities in the development of management plans for marine resources, and also for recognition of First Nation reliance on marine resources for food, social, and ceremonial needs and for economic development opportunities. The establishment of permanent no-take zones was met with both opposition and support. The most highly endorsed statement about no-take zones is one of principle\textemdash that they are a violation of Aboriginal rights. However, there was also strong agreement that permanent no-take zones would help reduce over-fishing. The National Marine Conservation Area program is in its infancy and it remains to be seen how the ``strictly protected'' zone of the legislation will be interpreted in relationship to Aboriginal harvesting practices. However it is clear that successful conservation will only occur with Aboriginal consent in many areas and there needs to be greater investment in understanding Aboriginal perspectives on marine conservation.},

When fish accumulate in a gear, the rate at which the gear catches fish can decline, and, as a result, catch asymptotes and q declines with longer fishing times. We used data from long-term trap surveys (1990-2011) in the southeastern U.S. Atlantic to determine whether traps saturated for 8 reef fish species because of the amount of time traps soaked or the level of fish accumulation (the total number of individuals of all fish species caught in a trap). We used a deltageneralized-additive model to relate the catch of each species to a variety of predictor variables to determine how eateh was infiuenced by soak time and fish accumulation after accounting for variability in catch due to the other predictor variables in the model. We found evidence of trap saturation for all 8 reef fish speeies examined. Traps beeame saturated for most speeies across the range of soak times examined, but trap saturation oeeurred for 3 fish speeies because of fish accumulation levels in the trap. Our results indicate that, to infer relative abundance levels from catch data, future studies should standardize catch or catch rates with nonlinear regression models that incorporate soak time, fish accumulation, and any other predictor variable that may ultimately infiuenee catch. Determination of the exact mechanisms that cause trap saturation is a eritieal need for aeeurate stock assessment, and our results indicate that these meehanisms may vary eonsiderably among species.},

  abstract = {The establishment of benthic marine habitat maps plays an important role in the conservation and management of coastal ecosystems faced with the increasing impacts of human activities. The Bay of Seine, bordering the eastern part of the English Channel, is an area undergoing considerable cumulative impacts, and which consequently requires a synthesis of our knowledge of the ecological status of its benthic habitats. Fortunately, numerous benthic sampling campaigns have been carried out over the last two decades, mainly in the eastern and western shallow parts of the bay. These campaigns have led to the construction of a database, allowing statistical analyses at the scale of the whole area which are then used to produce maps. Nevertheless, it appears that maps constructed using existing Natura 2000, EUNIS (European Nature Information System), and French MNHN (Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle) typologies are not enough detailed to distinguish the mosaic of habitats of the Seine estuary. It is indispensable to add expert judgements concerning local areas to updated maps of the benthic communities in the Bay of Seine. Several Natural Zones of Interest for Ecology in terms of Flora and Fauna named `ZNIEFF-Marine' areas have been identified, which could be useful in the future in the context of marine Natura 2000 sites for the management and conservation of endangered marine habitats in this maritime zone subject to highly conflicting interests.},

Basic methods have been extended by incorporating taxa sensitivity to dierent forms of stress, adding measures linked to system function, synthesizing multiple faunal groups, integrating biological and physical attributes, spanning large spatial scales, and enabling simulations through time. These tools can be customized to meet the needs of a particular assessment and ecosystem.

Their demonstrated vulnerability to exploitation has recently turned them into flagship species in ocean conservation. Yet, the assessment and monitoring of the distribution and abundance of such mobile species in marine environments remain challenging, often invasive and resource-intensive. Here we pilot a novel, rapid and non-invasive environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding approach specifically targeted to infer shark presence, diversity and eDNA read abundance in tropical habitats. We identified at least 21 shark species, from both Caribbean and Pacific Coral Sea water samples, whose geographical patterns of diversity and read abundance coincide with geographical differences in levels of anthropogenic pressure and conservation effort. We demonstrate that eDNA metabarcoding can be effectively employed to study shark diversity. Further developments in this field have the potential to drastically enhance our ability to assess and monitor elusive oceanic predators, and lead to improved conservation strategies.},

In the present study, we asked which attributes of the learning environment contribute to decreased female participation: the abundance of in-class interactions, the diversity of interactions, the proportion of women in class, the instructor's gender, the class size, and whether the course targeted lower division (first and second year) or upper division (third or fourth year) students. We calculated likelihood ratios of female participation from over 5300 student\textendash instructor interactions observed across multiple institutions. We falsified several alternative hypotheses and demonstrate that increasing class size has the largest negative effect.

However, little research has been conducted to compare the macrofauna associated with riprap-sill and riprap-hardened shorelines. Density and diversity of fish and blue crabs Callinectes sapidus were compared via weekly sampling along a riprap-sill shoreline, a riprap shoreline, and a shoreline fringed with smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora marsh in the Delaware Coastal Bays during summer 2010. Seining was conducted to quantitatively sample the shore zone and shallow subtidal regions, and minnow traps were used to determine the presence or absence of fishes in the mid- to upper-intertidal zone of each shoreline type. Temporally persistent differences in macrofaunal density and diversity were evident among the three shoreline types. In terms of fish density and diversity metrics, riprap-sill was more similar to the smooth cordgrass shoreline than to the traditional riprap shoreline. These results provide evidence for the biological advantage of riprap-sill over traditional riprap as a shoreline modification structure; spatial confirmation by further studies at different locations is warranted.},

Experimental evidence for a relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem process rates is compelling, but the issue remains contentious. Here, we present the first rigorous quantitative assessment of this relationship through meta-analysis of experimental work spanning 50 years to June 2004. We analysed 446 measures of biodiversity effects (252 in grasslands), 319 of which involved primary producer manipulations or measurements. Our analyses show that: biodiversity effects are weaker if biodiversity manipulations are less well controlled; effects of biodiversity change on processes are weaker at the ecosystem compared with the community level and are negative at the population level; productivity-related effects decline with increasing number of trophic links between those elements manipulated and those measured; biodiversity effects on stability measures (\^Oinsurance\~O effects) are not stronger than biodiversity effects on performance measures. For those ecosystem services which could be assessed here, there is clear evidence that biodiversity has positive effects on most. Whilst such patterns should be further confirmed, a precautionary approach to biodiversity management would seem prudent in the meantime.},

Treatment was at three levels (guided discovery, think-pair-share, and lecture strategies). Intervening variables were cognitive entry behavior at three levels (high, middle, and low) and gender at two levels (male and female). Two hundred forty-two Senior Secondary 1 students in intact classes from six secondary schools in Ijebu Ode and Odogbolu Local Government Areas of Ogun State were randomly assigned to the treatment and control groups. Three instruments were developed and used to collect data from students during the 8-week treatment program. The data collected were subjected to analysis of covariance and multiple classification analysis. Scheff\'e test was further used as post hoc measures. Where significant interactions were observed, they were represented with graphical illustrations. It was found that students taught with guided discovery and think-pair-share strategies obtained significantly higher posttest mean scores than those in the lecture strategy, F(4, 223) = 51.66, p {$<$} .05. The use of guided discovery and think-pair-share strategies had great potential for improving achievement in chemistry and science learning generally.},

Results indicate the entire continental shelf of Canada's Pacific marine waters is affected by multiple human activities at some level. Commercial fishing, land-based activities and marine transportation accounted for 57.0\%, 19.1\%, and 17.7\% of total cumulative impacts, respectively. Surprisingly, most areas with conservation designations contained higher impact scores than the mean values of their corresponding ecoregions.

  abstract = {Willapa Bay, Washington, USA, is a shallow, coastal-plain, upwelling-influenced estuary where Pacific oysters Crassostrea gigas are intensively cultivated. CTD transect data show that in the long-term average over the May to September growing season, Willapa Bay is a sink for oceanic phytoplankton, not a net exporter: as the tidal circulation stirs ocean water into the estuary, chlorophyll concentration declines by 30 to 60\% relative to a hypothetical dilution of the ocean end-member. A 3D circulation model (General Estuarine Transport Model, GETM) was modified to include a phytoplankton-like tracer subject to variable intertidal benthic grazing rates. The grazing rate that best reproduces the along-estuary phytoplankton biomass profile agrees, within confidence limits, with an estimate of cultivated-oyster filtration from literature values. Oysters and other intertidal benthic grazers may thus be the primary cause of the net loss of phytoplankton within the estuary in summer. These grazers appear to be within a small factor of their carrying capacity: as bay-total filtration capacity is increased in the model, the chlorophyll intrusion shortens and food intake per individual grazer declines. Nevertheless, only 8 to 15\% of the net tidal supply of oceanic phytoplankton is consumed within the estuary. Even in this well-flushed system, the small-scale structure of tidal transport \textemdash{} rather than total oceanic supply \textemdash{} controls overall food availability for the benthos.},

However, a global, quantitative view of how the biomass of different taxa compare with one another is still lacking. Here, we assemble the overall biomass composition of the biosphere, establishing a census of the {$\approx$}550 gigatons of carbon (Gt C) of biomass distributed among all of the kingdoms of life. We find that the kingdoms of life concentrate at different locations on the planet; plants ({$\approx$}450 Gt C, the dominant kingdom) are primarily terrestrial, whereas animals ({$\approx$}2 Gt C) are mainly marine, and bacteria ({$\approx$}70 Gt C) and archaea ({$\approx$}7 Gt C) are predominantly located in deep subsurface environments. We show that terrestrial biomass is about two orders of magnitude higher than marine biomass and estimate a total of {$\approx$}6 Gt C of marine biota, doubling the previous estimated quantity. Our analysis reveals that the global marine biomass pyramid contains more consumers than producers, thus increasing the scope of previous observations on inverse food pyramids. Finally, we highlight that the mass of humans is an order of magnitude higher than that of all wild mammals combined and report the historical impact of humanity on the global biomass of prominent taxa, including mammals, fish, and plants.},

Ecological research can play an important role in reinforcing the efforts of Indigenous land managers; and interest from Indigenous and non-Indigenous ecologists and land managers to work together on ecological issues of common concern is increasing. Although there are many examples of successful collaborations there are also many instances where expectations, particularly of the Indigenous partners, are not met, and this is less frequently communicated. This paper, written from the perspective of an Arrernte researcher in partnership with his non-Indigenous colleague, outlines a range of challenges including the need for Indigenous people to have more control of what is done and why it is done on their country and to define and prioritise their own objectives for land management, which may or may not align with mainstream conservation agendas. Currently, Western conservation paradigms play the dominant role in how Natural Resource Management is practiced and how broader policy is set, and ecological research on Indigenous land is still most often led by the Western ecologists. This can leave out the ideas of Indigenous people and does little to address underlying inequitable power relationships. Indigenous Australians do not want to become spectators in the research process, giving away knowledge, or labourers to Western conservation agendas. They want to be active partners in developing better understandings of the environment and implementers of management that reflects shared agendas. Open discussion of these issues within the mainstream ecological literature is an important step towards change and will create better opportunities for both Indigenous and non-Indigenous ecological practitioners and Indigenous people dealing with land management policy.},

  abstract = {Exploratory investigations of optimal sampling designs are a critical component of the decision-making process in ecology where inherent natural variation can lead to erroneous conclusions if left unexamined. Pilot studies and exploratory analyses that investigate the precision of sampling regimes may reduce the chances of erroneous results and can be used to optimise processing time in larger ecological research programs. In our study, we calculated optimal precision estimates for sampling macroinvertebrates and ichthyofauna in surf-zone wrack accumulations by investigating the precision of the mean for sub-samples of seine nets and also for the number of replicate seine nets to guide future sampling regimes. We discovered that the processing time for individual seine net samples could be reduced by 50\% using sub-sampling and that time to process replicate seine net samples could be reduced by 25\% while maintaining acceptable precision. In future, we suggest that the use of pilot studies with similar exploratory approaches should be less of an exception and more a critical component of ecological investigations, particularly in under-studied or newly-developing areas of research. Further, these types of exploratory approaches are crucially important in a variety of extremely patchy environments where variability is likely to be high.},

  abstract = {Theory predicts that loss of gape-limited sharks should lead to increases in the abundance and biomass of smaller size classes of prey. We used stereo-baited remote underwater video stations (stereo-BRUVS) and stereo diver-operated video systems (stereo-DOVS) to characterise the shark and fish assemblages on 2 remote, atoll-like reef systems in northwestern Australia, the Rowley Shoals and the Scott Reefs. Whereas the Rowley Shoals is a marine protected area, sharks have been removed from the Scott Reefs for over 3 centuries. We found that sharks were significantly more diverse, more abundant, larger in size and greater in biomass in the marine reserve relative to the Scott Reefs. Consistent with a priori hypotheses, bony fishes displayed greater species diversity, abundance and biomass where sharks were common relative to the predator-depleted location. The size and trophic structure of bony fish assemblages also differed between locations. Our results provide large-scale evidence consistent with the hypothesis that reef-associated sharks are gape-limited trophic omnivores that impose top-down effects on medium sized ({$<$} 50 cm), low- to mid-trophic level fishes. On stereo-BRUVS, for example, prey in the 0 to 29.99 cm size class had 203\% more biomass at the predator-depleted reef relative to the location where sharks were abundant. As body size is an important determinant of ecological role and fitness in fishes, these findings suggest that the rapid and ongoing loss of sharks from reefs globally may have important implications for reef management and investigations into the effect of fishing on reef systems.},

  abstract = {Population ecology has classically focused on pairwise species interactions, hindering the description of general patterns and processes of population abundance at large spatial scales. Here we use the metabolic theory of ecology as a framework to formulate and test a model that yields predictions linking population density to the physiological constraints of body size and temperature on individual metabolism, and the ecological constraints of trophic structure and species richness on energy partitioning among species. Our model was tested by applying Bayesian quantile regression to a comprehensive reef-fish community database, from which we extracted density data for 5609 populations spread across 49 sites around the world. Our results indicate that population density declines markedly with increases in community species richness and that, after accounting for richness, energetic constraints are manifested most strongly for the most abundant species, which generally are of small body size and occupy lower trophic groups. Overall, our findings suggest that, at the global scale, factors associated with community species richness are the major drivers of variation in population density. Given that populations of species-rich tropical systems exhibit markedly lower maximum densities, they may be particularly susceptible to stochastic extinction.},

  abstract = {Reef structural complexity provides important refuge habitat for a range of marine organisms, and is a useful indicator of the health and resilience of reefs as a whole. Marine scientists have recently begun to use `Structure from Motion' (SfM) photogrammetry in order to accurately and repeatably capture the 3D structure of physical objects underwater, including reefs. There has however been limited research on the comparability of this new method with existing analogue methods already used widely for measuring and monitoring 3D structure, such as `tape and chain rugosity index (RI)' and graded visual assessments. Our findings show that analogue and SfM RI can be reliably converted over a standard 10-m reef section (SfM RI = 1.348 \^A chain RI\textemdash 0.359, r2 = 0.82; and Chain RI = 0.606 \^A SfM RI + 0.465) for RI values up to 2.0; however, SfM RI values above this number become increasingly divergent from traditional tape and chain measurements. Additionally, we found SfM RI correlates well with visual assessment grades of coral reefs over a 10 \^A 10 m area (SfM RI = 0.1461 \^A visual grade + 1.117; r2 = 0.83). The SfM method is shown to be affordable and non-destructive whilst also allowing the data collected to be archival, less biased by the observer, and broader in its scope of applications than standard methods. This work allows researchers to easily transition from analogue to digital structural assessment techniques, facilitating continued long-term monitoring, whilst also improving the quality and additional research value of the data collected.},

We review the history of Canada's Pacific coast fishery to show that trends in catch were similar to trends in the climate and ocean environment. Decadal scale patterns in climate and the ocean are termed regimes and we show that it is the regime scale of climate variability that most influences the long-term trends in the catches in these major fisheries. Ignoring the impacts of regime shifts on the abundance trends in the future could result in collapses of major fisheries. The difficulty of knowing when a regime shift will occur may be overcome as we discover more about the mechanisms that affect the decadal-scale trends in the rotational velocity of the solid earth which is measured as the length of day (LOD).},

At the same time, ecological restoration is widely being implemented as a response to environmental degradation and biodiversity loss.                                Rey Benayas                 et al.

The analysis of 89 published restoration projects worldwide establishes that ecological restoration does, in general, have positive impacts on both biodiversity and provision of ecosystem services. These effects are especially marked in the tropics. Thus, ecological restoration actions may indeed deliver benefits, both in terms of biodiversity conservation and supporting human livelihoods.                        ,              Restoration, biodiversity, and ecosystem services are positively linked in a wide range of ecosystem types across the globe.           ,              Ecological restoration is widely used to reverse the environmental degradation caused by human activities. However, the effectiveness of restoration actions in increasing provision of both biodiversity and ecosystem services has not been evaluated systematically. A meta-analysis of 89 restoration assessments in a wide range of ecosystem types across the globe indicates that ecological restoration increased provision of biodiversity and ecosystem services by 44 and 25\%, respectively. However, values of both remained lower in restored versus intact reference ecosystems. Increases in biodiversity and ecosystem service measures after restoration were positively correlated. Results indicate that restoration actions focused on enhancing biodiversity should support increased provision of ecosystem services, particularly in tropical terrestrial biomes.},

  abstract = {Different procedures for underwater sampling of epifaunal organisms were compared for their robustness to bias due to observers and precision using multifactonal sampling designs. Variability among 3 observers was tested in relation to: (1) the method employed to estimate the percent cover of organisms (visual vs point-intercept technique); ( 2 )the size of quadrats (50 X 50 vs 20 X 20 cm); (3) stress (sampling at the b e g \textasciitilde{} n n i n gvs the end of the dive), and ( 4 ) random factors that were likely to change from dive to dive. Precision was expressed in terms of standard errors (over 3 replicates) obtained with each method and size. Two cnidarians (Astrojdes calycularis and Leptosarnmia pruvoti) a n d 2 sponges (Petrosia ficiforrnis and Geodia cydoniurn) w e r e considered in this study because of their a b u n d a n c e a t the study site ( a submarine cave). Much of the variability was related to significant differences between observers that changed from dive to dive for estimates of the cover of A. calycularis, and from dive to dive and with method for L. pruvoti. The small quadrats were more precise than the large ones when used to estimate the percent cover of A. calycularis a n d L. pruvoti, irrespective of method. In contrast, for P ficiformis the small quadrats were more precise if sampled with the visual method, while the reverse occurred for the large quadrats. A trend toward a greater precision of the large quadrats sampled with the visual method was evident for G. cydoniurn, although n o significant effects were found. Pilot studies a n d cost-benefit analyses were also used to determine the optimal allocation of resources (time) for sampling epifaunal organisms a t different spatial scales in the cave, for each method and size of quadrats. The small units in conjunction with the v \textasciitilde{} s u aml ethod were most efficient. This procedure offered the best compromise between repeatability among observers, precision and maxin\textasciitilde izationof replication for a fixed amount of resources. The large quadrats in conjunction wlth the visual method were probably more adequate for G. cydonium, given the apparent greater precision provided by this procedure for the large sponge. Caution is recommended in en\textasciitilde ployingdifferent researchers working on the same sampling project in extreme environments, at least before divergence among observers to c h a n g \textasciitilde{} n genvironmental conditions is accounted for.},

  abstract = {A new time-dependent continuous model of biomass size spectra is developed. In this model, predation is the single process governing the energy flow in the ecosystem, as it causes both growth and mortality. Predation is size-dependent. The ratio of predator to prey is assumed to be distributed: predators may feed on a range of prey sizes. Under these assumptions, it is proven that linear size spectra are stationary solutions of the model. The slope of this size spectrum is insensitive to the magnitude of processes in the food web, such as the width of prey size distribution, the volume of water searched while foraging or the assimilation efficiency. Exploited fish communities are simulated by adding a size-dependent fishing mortality to the model: it is found that realistic fishing pressures should not affect the slope of size spectra, but their shape and stationarity.},

We surveyed the international literature to focus on the role of Traditional Ecological Knowledge in monitoring, responding to, and managing ecosystem processes and functions, with special attention to ecological resilience. Case studies revealed that there exists a diversity of local or traditional practices for ecosystem management. These include multiple species management, resource rotation, succession management, landscape patchiness management, and other ways of responding to and managing pulses and ecological surprises. Social mechanisms behind these traditional practices include a number of adaptations for the generation, accumulation, and transmission of knowledge; the use of local institutions to provide leaders/stewards and rules for social regulation; mechanisms for cultural internalization of traditional practices; and the development of appropriate world views and cultural values. Some traditional knowledge and management systems were characterized by the use of local ecological knowledge to interpret and respond to feedbacks from the environment to guide the direction of resource management. These traditional systems had certain similarities to adaptive management with its emphasis on feedback learning, and its treatment of uncertainty and unpredictability intrinsic to all ecosystems.},

Here, we test the hypothesis\textemdash derived from biodiversity\textendash ecosystem functioning theory\textemdash that species richness and ecological functional diversity allow seafood diets to fulfill multiple nutritional requirements, a condition necessary for human health. We analyzed a newly synthesized dataset of 7,245 observations of nutrient and contaminant concentrations in 801 aquatic animal taxa and found that species with different ecological traits have distinct and complementary micronutrient profiles but little difference in protein content. The same complementarity mechanisms that generate positive biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning in terrestrial ecosystems also operate in seafood assemblages, allowing more diverse diets to yield increased nutritional benefits independent of total biomass consumed. Notably, nutritional metrics that capture multiple micronutrients and fatty acids essential for human well-being depend more strongly on biodiversity than common ecological measures of function such as productivity, typically reported for grasslands and forests. Furthermore, we found that increasing species richness did not increase the amount of protein in seafood diets and also increased concentrations of toxic metal contaminants in the diet. Seafoodderived micronutrients and fatty acids are important for human health and are a pillar of global food and nutrition security. By drawing upon biodiversity\textendash ecosystem functioning theory, we demonstrate that ecological concepts of biodiversity can deepen our understanding of nature's benefits to people and unite sustainability goals for biodiversity and human well-being.},

Both indices are based on a classification of macrofauna into ecological groups (EG), and their transfer to tropical waters required some adaptations. These indices proved efficient in detecting a degradation of habitat quality. Their use resulted in the classification of all sites sampled between 1996 and 1998 as ``good'' or ``high''. M-AMBI nevertheless tended to result in the attribution of a slightly worse ecological quality status than AMBI. Together with an update of the EG species list for the Indian Ocean area, our results support the extension of both indices for the assessment of tropical soft bottoms.},

Hatchery fish were produced for three consecutive years by using broodstock comprised of endemic juveniles that were caught in the wild and raised to maturity, and then the program transitioned to an integrated broodstock comprised of wild and hatchery adults that returned to spawn. Importantly, some auxiliary conservation-based husbandry protocols were attempted (i.e., pairwise mating between males and females) but not always completed due to insufficient broodstock and conflict between production and conservation goals. The hatchery met production goals in 6 of 9 years, but wild-type genetic integrity of hatchery fish was degraded every year. Specifically, we analyzed 10 microsatellites and observed a 60\% reduction in the effective number of breeders in the hatchery (harmonic mean of hatchery, Nb = 45, compared with the wild, Nb = 111). Hatchery fish consequently displayed reduced genetic diversity and large temporal genetic divergence compared with wild counterparts. To ensure the benefit of conservation-based husbandry, spawning protocols should be based on scientific theory and be practical within the physical and biological constraints of the system. Finally, if conservation issues are considered to be the most important issue for hatchery propagation, then production goals may need to be forfeited.},

We develop an easy-to-use alternative without these problems; it generalizes the popular multiple imputation (MI) framework by treating missing data problems as a limiting special case of extreme measurement error and corrects for both. Like MI, the proposed framework is a simple two-step procedure, so that in the second step researchers can use whatever statistical method they would have if there had been no problem in the first place. We also offer empirical illustrations, open source software that implements all the methods described herein, and a companion article with technical details and extensions.},

In this study, we tested the utility of this strategy in preventing phenotypic and genetic divergences between captive-bred and wild animals that could be detrimental for wild populations. Combining microsatellite analyses, morphological measurements and behavioural trials in the laboratory, we compared the progeny of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) born in captivity with individuals born in the wild. At all these levels, we found significant differences between the progeny of the two groups. Specifically, allelic frequencies significantly differed between groups, with captive-bred fish tending to be less variable with lower heterozygosity and allelic richness values. The shape of wild-born fish was also different from that of the captive-group, particularly in the depth of the head and the length of the pectoral fins. Finally, captive-bred individuals were, on average, more aggressive than wild-born fish. We demonstrated that this difference was strongly dependent upon the environment as captive-bred fish were more aggressive only when together with their wild conspecifics or with an exotic competitor, the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Overall, our results showed that both phenotypic and genetic changes can arise even if genitors share a common brood-stock and after only a few months of rearing in a controlled environment. We conclude that the progeny produced in such supportive breeding programs does not meet the criteria necessary to ensure preserving the genetic and ecological integrity of wild populations.},

Nevertheless, information on inter-tidal community composition in the Caribbean Basin and at other oceanic sites is lacking. Such information is essential to developing a more comprehensive understanding of rocky inter-tidal systems and their responses to global change. The goals of this study were to determine the relative importance of environmental (wave power density, wave height), habitat (e.g. algal cover, slope, complexity of rock surfaces) and anthropogenic (distance to roads, population density) factors associated with the structure of local assemblages at multiple shore heights and the regional metacommunity of mobile invertebrates on oceanic rocky inter-tidal habitats. Environmental characteristics associated with habitat complexity (algal cover, rock surface complexity) and human population density were most strongly associated with abundance and biodiversity of invertebrates. Species richness was positively correlated with surface complexity, but abundance was negatively correlated with both surface complexity and per cent algal cover. By contrast, abundance of invertebrates was positively correlated with human population density, and diversity was negatively correlated with human population density. Abundance of invertebrates was greatest in the mid inter-tidal zone, whereas diversity was greatest in the lower inter-tidal zone. Metacommunity structure was Gleasonian, but the gradient along which species turnover occurred was correlated with measures of wave exposure, rather than anthropogenic activity. Unlike in previous studies, mostly at mainland sites, human activity primarily altered dominance patterns of communities, while having relatively little effect on species richness or composition.},

With a total of 236 observations, ANCOVA of log(population density) versus log(mean body size) showed a negative dependence with an estimated slope of - 0.984 ? 0.148 (95\% confidence interval) and intercepts significantly varying among stream sites. As previously published data indicate the metabolic rate of fishes proportional to (body weight)09, the result supports the hypothesis of energetic equivalence; that is, the total energy flow through a population tends to be constant within but varying among sites and populations. In a review of the theory of self-thinning in food-regulated animals, we emphasize the effects of a negatively size-dependent growth and mortality; each will modify the thinning line, but combined they will tend to compensate for each other.},

A crucial outcome of such behaviors has been the dramatic reshaping of the global biosphere, a transformation whose early origins are increasingly apparent from cumulative archaeological and paleoecological datasets. Such data suggest that, by the Late Pleistocene, humans had begun to engage in activities that have led to alterations in the distributions of a vast array of species across most, if not all, taxonomic groups. Changes to biodiversity have included extinctions, extirpations, and shifts in species composition, diversity, and community structure. We outline key examples of these changes, highlighting findings from the study of new datasets, like ancient DNA (aDNA), stable isotopes, and microfossils, as well as the application of new statistical and computational methods to datasets that have accumulated significantly in recent decades. We focus on four major phases that witnessed broad anthropogenic alterations to biodiversity\textemdash the Late Pleistocene global human expansion, the Neolithic spread of agriculture, the era of island colonization, and the emergence of early urbanized societies and commercial networks. Archaeological evidence documents millennia of anthropogenic transformations that have created novel ecosystems around the world. This record has implications for ecological and evolutionary research, conservation strategies, and the maintenance of ecosystem services, pointing to a significant need for broader cross-disciplinary engagement between archaeology and the biological and environmental sciences.},

  abstract = {Information-theoretic (IT) and multi-model averaging (MMA) statistical approaches are widely used but suboptimal tools for pursuing a multifactorial approach (also known as the method of multiple working hypotheses) in ecology. (1) Conceptually, IT encourages ecologists to perform tests on sets of straw-man models. (2) MMA improves on IT model comparison by implementing a simple form of shrinkage estimation (a way to make accurate predictions from a model with many parameters, by ``shrinking'' parameter estimates toward zero). However, newer approaches to shrinkage estimation are faster and have more rigorous statistical underpinnings. (3) It is likely that correct confidence intervals (CIs) for MMA (and other shrinkage estimates) are no narrower than those from the original (full) model. If researchers want to accurately estimate the strength of multiple competing ecological processes along with reliable confidence intervals, their best hope is to use full (maximal) statistical models after making principled, a priori decisions about which predictors to include.},

The results obtained are consistent with those obtained using several methods and parameters, such as richness, diversity, evenness, Abundance\textendash Biomass comparison plots and univariate and multivariate statistical analyses.

  abstract = {The European Union-funded ECASA project (Ecosystem Approach for Sustainable Aquaculture) studied the impacts from aquaculture on ecosystems from northern Norway to Greece. The objectives of this investigation were to identify quantitative indicators of the effects of aquaculture on marine communities, and to assess their applicability over a range of ecosystems and aquaculture production systems. The study included 6 Mediterranean and 4 Atlantic sites, 7 of which produced finfish (seabream, seabass, tuna, salmon and cod), and 2 bivalve molluscs (oysters, mussels, and clams); one site produced both fish and bivalves. Cultivation methods included finfish cages, long-lines and trestles. Similar sampling methodologies were employed at the 10 study sites, obtaining sediment, hydrodynamic, and benthic faunal data. The horizontal impact from organic enrichment extended 50 m from the farms, with contradictory responses in several indicators (individual abundance, biomass) and a more consistent response of the Infaunal Trophic Index (ITI) and AZTI's Marine Biotic Index (AMBI). By means of Partial Redundancy Analysis, it was demonstrated that the environmental variables explained 53.2\% of the variability in the macrofaunal variables (individual abundance, species richness, diversity, AMBI and ITI), whilst the explained variance was partialled out within three groups of variables: (i) `hydrography' (depth, distance to farm, average current speed), which explained 11.5\% of the variance; (ii) `sediment' (Eh and percentages of silt and total organic matter), which explained 5.4\%; and (iii) `cages' (years of production and annual production), which explained 15.2\%. The shared variance explained by interactions among these groups was 21.1\%. These results, together with multiple regression analysis, provide an accurate assessment of the degree of impact from aquaculture. In conclusion, the use of several benthic indicators, in assessing farm impacts, together with the investigation of dynamics of the studied location, water depth, years of farm activity, and total annual production, must be included when interpreting the response of benthic communities to organic enrichment from aquaculture.},

  abstract = {Many ecological phenomena are characterized by context dependency, and the relationship between diversity and productivity is no exception. We examined the relationship between macroalgal diversity and nutrient availability by evaluating the effects of reduced nutrients and their subsequent replacement via local-scale nutrient loading in tide pools. Macroalgae in Oregon coast high-intertidal pools have evolved in a nitrate-rich upwelling ecosystem, but instead of settling on low-intertidal reefs (where algae are often immersed in nutrient-rich nearshore waters) these individuals have colonized high-zone pools, where they are isolated from the ocean for extended periods of time and are subjected to extended periods of nitrate depletion. In some pools, this nutrient stress was ameliorated by a positive interaction: the excretion of ammonium by invertebrates. We conducted experimental manipulations to quantify invertebrate-mediated ammonium loading and macroalgal ammonium uptake in high-intertidal pools. Variation in tide pool volume and invertebrate biomass created a gradient of local-scale nutrient inputs, allowing us to address the relationship between nitrogen loading and algal diversity. Slow-growing species tolerant of low nitrogen availability were joined by fast-growing species with higher nitrogen requirements in pools with higher ammonium loading rates. A fourfold increase in the ammonium loading rate was associated with a doubling in the number of macroalgal species, and macroalgal assemblages in more species-rich pools were characterized by higher rates of biomass-specific ammonium uptake. These patterns contrast with productivity-diversity relationships in terrestrial systems, where local-scale nutrient enrichments generally result in reduced producer diversity due to displacement of subordinate species by aggressive competitors. Our data suggest that the effect of enrichment on diversity is context-dependent. Each ecosystem has a critical level of nutrient availability, determined by the level of nutrients typically available in that system. Below this critical level, local-scale nutrient additions increase diversity, but above it, diversity declines with enrichment.},

Salmon from two susceptible (Salmo salar, Oncorhynchus keta) and one resistant (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) species were exposed to adult L. salmonis. After 24 and 48 h, skin samples directly below the attachment site and at non-attachment sites were assessed for transcriptomic profiles of select innate defense genes. Abrasion of the skin permitted comparisons between abrasionassociated injury and louse-associated injury. Infection responses were consistently higher than those caused by abrasion. Temporal patterns of expression were evident in all species for the transcription factor CCAAT/ enhancer-binding protein {$\beta$} (C/EBP-{$\beta$}), the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) and the enzyme prostaglandin D synthase (PGDS) at attachment sites. O. gorbuscha was the highest responder in a number of genes while there was an absence of C-reactive protein (CRP) gene expression in S. salar and O. keta, indicating an altered acute-phase response. Moreover, O. keta displayed distinct interleukin-8 (IL-8) and serum amyloid P (SAP) responses. Impaired genetic expression or over-expression in these pathways may be evidence for speciesspecific pathways of susceptibility to the parasite. At L. salmonis attachment sites, reduced expression compared to non-attachment sites was observed for C/EBP-{$\beta$} (S. salar), CRP (S. salar), SAP (S. salar, O. gorbuscha, O. keta), PGDS (S. salar, O. gorbuscha, O. keta), and major histocompatibility class II (MH class II, S. salar), suggesting local immunodepression.},

The fishery is of concern because of high harvest levels and potential indirect impacts of sheephead removals on the structure and function of kelp forest ecosystems. California sheephead are protogynous hermaphrodites that, as predators of sea urchins and other invertebrates, are critical components of kelp forest ecosystems in the northeast Pacific. Overfishing can trigger trophic cascades and widespread ecological dysfunction when other urchin predators are also lost from the system. Little is known about the ecology and abundance of sheephead before commercial exploitation. Lack of a historical perspective creates a gap for evaluating fisheries management measures and marine reserves that seek to rebuild sheephead populations to historical baseline conditions. We use population abundance and size structure data from the zooarchaeological record, in concert with isotopic data, to evaluate the long-term health and viability of sheephead fisheries in southern California. Our results indicate that the importance of sheephead to the diet of native Chumash people varied spatially across the Channel Islands, reflecting modern biogeographic patterns. Comparing ancient (\textasciitilde 10,000 calibrated years before the present to 1825 CE) and modern samples, we observed variability and significant declines in the relative abundance of sheephead, reductions in size frequency distributions, and shifts in the dietary niche between ancient and modern collections.

  abstract = {Understanding linkages among life history traits, the environment, and population dynamics is a central goal in ecology. We compared 15 populations of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) to test general hypotheses for the relative importance of life history traits and environmental conditions in explaining variation in population dynamics. We used life history traits and habitat variables as covariates in mixed-effect Ricker models to evaluate the support for correlates of maximum population growth rates, density dependence, and variability in dynamics among populations. We found dramatic differences in the dynamics of populations that spawn in a small geographical area. These differences among populations were related to variation in habitats but not life history traits. Populations that spawned in deep water had higher and less variable population growth rates, and populations inhabiting streams with larger gravels experienced stronger negative density dependence. These results demonstrate, in these populations, the relative importance of environmental conditions and life histories in explaining population dynamics, which is rarely possible for multiple populations of the same species. Furthermore, they suggest that local habitat variables are important for the assessment of population status, especially when multiple populations with different dynamics are managed as aggregates.},

  abstract = {As ecosystems come under increasing anthropogenic pressure, rare species face the highest risk of extinction. Paradoxically, data necessary to evaluate the conservation status of rare species are often lacking because of the challenges of detecting species with low abundance. One group of fishes subject to this undersampling bias are those with cryptic body patterns. Twenty-one percent of cryptic fish species assessed for their extinction risk (International Union for Conservation of Nature [IUCN]) are data deficient. We developed a nondestructive method for surveying cryptically patterned marine fishes based on the presence of biofluorescence (underwater biofluorescence census, UBC). Blue LED torches were used to investigate how widespread biofluorescence was in cryptic reef fishes in the Coral Triangle region. The effectiveness of UBC to generate abundance data was tested on a data-deficient pygmy seahorse species (Hippocampus bargibanti) and compared with data obtained from standard underwater visual census (UVC) surveys. We recorded 95 reef fish species displaying biofluorescence, 73 of which had not been previously described as biofluorescent. Of those fish with cryptic patterns, 87\% were biofluorescent compared with 9\% for noncryptic fishes. The probability of species displaying biofluorescence was 70.9 times greater for cryptic species than for noncryptic species. Almost twice the number of H. bargibanti was counted using the UBC compared with UVC. For 2 triplefin species (Ucla xenogrammus, Enneapterygius tutuilae), the abundance detected with UBC was triple that detected with UVC. The UBC method was effective at finding cryptic species that would otherwise be difficult to detect and thus will reduce interobserver variability inherent to UVC surveys. Biofluorescence is ubiquitous in cryptic fishes, making this method applicable across a wide range of species. Data collected using UBC could be used with multiple IUCN criteria to assess the extinction risk of cryptic species. Adopting this technique will enhance researchers' ability to survey cryptic species and facilitate management and conservation of cryptic marine species.},

Metabolic rate, the rate at which organisms take up, transform, and expend energy and materials, is the most fundamental biological rate. We have developed a quantitative theory for how metabolic rate varies with body size and temperature. Metabolic theory predicts how metabolic rate, by setting the rates of resource uptake from the environment and resource allocation to survival, growth, and reproduction, controls ecological processes at all levels of organization from individuals to the biosphere. Examples include: (1) life history attributes, including development rate, mortality rate, age at maturity, life span, and population growth rate; (2) population interactions, including carrying capacity, rates of competition and predation, and patterns of species diversity; and (3) ecosystem processes, including rates of biomass production and respiration and patterns of trophic dynamics.},

This study examined the species composition, relative abundances, and biodiversity indices of mobile benthic fauna in geoduck farm areas of southern Puget Sound. Surveys of geoduck farms in two different stages of aquaculture production were carried out using a trapping strategy with two types of traps. The site in Eld Inlet had predator protection tubes around the planted geoduck. The site in Nisqually Reach was in grow-out phase with no predator protection. Nearby areas with no aquaculture were used as control sites. Traps yielded 1,161 individuals from 15 species of mobile benthic animals during the course of this study. The graceful crab, Cancer gracilis, accounted for 76.3\% of all specimens. The effects of geoduck aquaculture on biodiversity were subtle and not consistent between the two locations. Using Coleman rarefaction analysis, species richness was significantly higher (P {$<$} 0.05) in the geoduck farm in Eld Inlet compared with its control site, but no significant difference was observed in species richness between the geoduck farm in Nisqually Reach with its control site. Biodiversity was higher in Nisqually Reach compared with Eld Inlet, and Simpson's biodiversity index for the Nisqually Reach geoduck farm was significantly higher than its control site (0.73 and 0.62, respectively, P {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.001). Large differences in capture rates were noted between female and male Cancer gracilis crab in Eld Inlet and Nisqually Reach. Possible causes of the observed differences between the sites are discussed.},

This study examined how prey type and condition of stomach contents influenced identification of prey and the ability to estimate dietary importance by methodologies based on volume, weight, number and frequency of occurrence. A total of 154 stomachs were examined from six trophically diverse, temperate fish species. The condition of prey i.e. entirety, digestion state, and presence of mucus were recorded for each stomach, and the taxonomic level to which prey could be identified to assessed. The influence of prey condition on the application of each metric was then assessed. Descriptions based on prey volume or weight were significantly affected by differences in prey condition. In contrast, the simple presence/absence or frequency of occurrence approach (\%F) provided a rapid, unambiguous and reliable account of diet composition and was not affected by the condition of prey. It was the only approach able to quantify the full spectrum of prey types in a consistent manner, making it the most practical metric. Variable prey condition also highlighted uncertainties in prey identification. We recommend routine reporting of how prey condition influences identification, the specific approaches used, and any assumptions made in identifying prey. In addition, \%F data should be reported as a nested hierarchy of taxonomic levels which allows these data to be readily standardised across studies and used in meta-analyses.},

However, cross-system comparisons in 615N can be complicated by differences in 815N at the base of the food chain. Such baseline variation in 815N is difficult to resolve using plankton because of the large temporal variability in the 815N of small organisms that have fast nitrogen turnover. Comparisons using large primary consumers, which have stable tissue isotopic signatures because of their slower nitrogen turnover, show that 81'N increases markedly with the human population density in the lake watershed. This shift in 81-N likely reflects the high 815N of human sewage. Correcting for this baseline variation in 815N, we report that, contrary to expectations based on previous food-web analysis, the food chains leading up to fish varied by about only one trophic level among the 40 lakes studied. Our results also suggest that the 815N signatures of nitrogen at the base of the food chain will provide a useful tool in the assessment of anthropogenic nutrient inputs.},

  abstract = {Three flawed practices associated with model averaging coefficients for predictor variables in regression models commonly occur when making multimodel inferences in analyses of ecological data. Model-averaged regression coefficients based on Akaike information criterion (AIC) weights have been recommended for addressing model uncertainty but they are not valid, interpretable estimates of partial effects for individual predictors when there is multicollinearity among the predictor variables. Multicollinearity implies that the scaling of units in the denominators of the regression coefficients may change across models such that neither the parameters nor their estimates have common scales, therefore averaging them makes no sense. The associated sums of AIC model weights recommended to assess relative importance of individual predictors are really a measure of relative importance of models, with little information about contributions by individual predictors compared to other measures of relative importance based on effects size or variance reduction. Sometimes the model-averaged regression coefficients for predictor variables are incorrectly used to make model-averaged predictions of the response variable when the models are not linear in the parameters. I demonstrate the issues with the first two practices using the college grade point average example extensively analyzed by Burnham and Anderson. I show how partial standard deviations of the predictor variables can be used to detect changing scales of their estimates with multicollinearity. Standardizing estimates based on partial standard deviations for their variables can be used to make the scaling of the estimates commensurate across models, a necessary but not sufficient condition for model averaging of the estimates to be sensible. A unimodal distribution of estimates and valid interpretation of individual parameters are additional requisite conditions. The standardized estimates or equivalently the t statistics on unstandardized estimates also can be used to provide more informative measures of relative importance than sums of AIC weights. Finally, I illustrate how seriously compromised statistical interpretations and predictions can be for all three of these flawed practices by critiquing their use in a recent species distribution modeling technique developed for predicting Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) distribution in Colorado, USA. These model averaging issues are common in other ecological literature and ought to be discontinued if we are to make effective scientific contributions to ecological knowledge and conservation of natural resources.},

These modifications are physical manifestations of resource management activities foundational to the cultures of the region. However, the ability to identify and record the regional variation in these intertidal feature complexes is hampered by the large distances that need to be covered within extremely short and rare low tide sequences. We used aerial photography from a low-flying helicopter during extreme low tides to cover large areal expanses of shoreline in the traditional territory of the Northern Coast Salish. Our bird's eye view allowed us to identify diverse intertidal modifications and a suite of ``elements'', the smallest repeating forms of intertidal modification. The elements that make up the features are in turn combined in different ways to create larger intertidal modifications. The elements provide the basis for an intertidal feature typology that is consistent with local oral historical knowledge about ancient management systems and activities.},

  abstract = {Analyses of shellfish remains from sites on the Pacific Northwest Coast show a mix of temporal and spatial trends, which have been variously attributed to human impacts on populations or to environmental changes. We review studies from a number of sites throughout the region and from an area on the central coast of British Columbia to show local and regional trends in species emphasis, which are generally consistent with opportunistic use of environmentally available resources. Against this backdrop, we present growth increment analysis of clam shell (Saxidomus gigantea and Tresus capax) from central coast sites that indicates a variety of specific patterns and longer term strategies in shellfish use. These include casual collection from the immediate vicinity of smaller campsites, intensive harvest at specialized locations, and selective gathering from base camps and villages. The results of this multi-site study point to the complex variety of patterns likely to be evident throughout the region, and highlight the value of new research strategies and methods. The archaeological history of shellfish use on the Northwest Coast has not generally been the subject of sustained systematic investigation, despite the ubiquity of shell in coastal sites. Research has not developed much beyond descriptions of site contents, trial seasonality studies, taphonomic analyses, and initial observations of trends in species representation or shell size, which are attributed to either human predation or environmental change. Any implications for variable and developing collection strategies over time have been difficult to evaluate with the available data. We briefly review current knowledge and investigations of shellfish use on the Pacific Northwest Coast of North America, and present the initial results of a more extensive, multi-site investigation on the central coast of British Columbia. These results are beginning to reveal specific patterns of shellfish use, and indicate more general strategies of harvest and management extending to as early as 5000 years ago.},

Because studies relating habitat characteristics with the distribution and presence of rockfishes at large scales (100s of kilometres) remain scarce, we sought to investigate the relationships between benthic characteristics with the presence\textendash absence and abundance of rockfishes caught in longline surveys in nearshore waters of southern British Columbia. Habitat parameters were calculated from a 20 m resolution bathymetry layer. Yelloweye and quillback were examined separately and combined with 19 other rockfish species in a species aggregate (total rockfish); occurrence data were fitted with generalized linear mixed effects models, and abundance data were fitted with zero-inflated mixed effects models. The relationship between rockfish abundance with presence\textendash absence and slope, distance to rocky habitat, and fine bathymetric position index suggests that these species prefer rocky, steep habitat. While underwater visual observation data offer measures of visual fish habitat and abundance, longline surveys may be a more cost-effective method for large-scale studies.},

  abstract = {Generally, environments with a great habitat complexity (HC) can support a great number of species and large abundances of organisms. However, the mechanisms behind this effect are not entirely clear and some studies did not observe positive effects of complexity on diversity and abundance of biological assemblages. Here, HC was considered as an integrative perspective, specifically as different characteristics of physical structure and; it was tested whether abundance and diversity of macrobenthic assemblages of soft bottom are influenced by variation of two characteristics of habitat complexity, the number and evenness of sediment fractions. The hypothesized positive relationships between HC and richness, Shannon-Wiener diversity index and abundance of benthic macrofauna were not observed. The different response variables (richness, Shannon-Wiener, abundance) which consider different dimensions of biodiversity, can show distinct results when the same habitat is compared. For both structural characteristics of the sediment, a large amount of specimens of Bispira sp. (Polychaeta: Sabellidae) and Terebellides sp. (Polychaeta: Trichobranchidae) were observed in the most complex treatments. These taxa were favored by the presence of gravels where their larvae, likely originated from adult populations at nearby habitats, can settle. The multidimensional structure of the benthic macrofauna was significantly influenced by habitat complexity; and considering high taxonomical and functional diversity, multivariate analyses were more appropriated to investigate such complex effects. In this context, it is clear that careful thought must be given to choose appropriated habitat complexity characteristics and biological measurements. Therefore, studies addressing different combinations of structural characteristics of habitat and mechanisms behind the effects on biological communities are still of great need in ecological science.},

As this objective involves considering fish within a broader system, it seems their research work inspired system thinking. Nevertheless, during the experiment session, they tried to link their comments to a traditional evaluation. Their research questions were completely conditioned by what they thought they would be assessed on under usual conditions. On this basis, they only chose to know the name of the parts and their practical uses. Therefore, although they initially considered the environment as a part to study to learn how fish function, evaluation limited their research to finalist questions. Other results, such as observation of the peer learning process, are also shown.},

The lake is considered to be recovering from eutrophication after the termination of an urban sewage inflow in 2000, and its waters are replenished constantly from the nearby oligotrophic Lake Trichonis. The results show that, although a decrease in nutrient concentrations was observed compared to the past, the lake still has eutrophic characteristics. This was reflected in the zooplankton community which is typical of those found in eutrophic lakes where rotifers prevail. Similarities among this lake and other nearby lakes were found considering the zooplankton community composition and seasonal variation. However, Lake Lysimachia is inhabited also by a number of different and even unique species (e.g., Moina micrura), suggesting that this ecosystem may be an important biodiversity refuge. Most of the zooplankton species were correlated with water temperature and, to a lesser extent, eutrophication key-water quality variables.

Describing how density varies spatially is often of equal interest; however, conventional methods of analysis do not allow for explicit modeling of both density and detection probability. The function distsamp implements the multinomial-Poisson mixture model of Royle et al. (2004), which was developed to overcome this limitation. This model requires that line- or point-transects are spatially replicated and that distance data are recorded in discrete intervals. The function gdistsamp extends this basic model, by introducing the parameter {$\varphi$}, the probability of being available for detection (Chandler et al., 2011). Furthermore, this function allows abundance to be modeled using the negative binomial distribution, which may be useful for dealing with over-dispersion. This document describes how to format data, fit models, and manipulate results in package unmarked.

The three most common sampling methods that produce suitable data are removal sampling, double observer sampling, and capture-recapture methods. This document focuses on the analysis of capture-recapture data using a class of models known as multinomial N -mixture models (Royle, 2004; Dorazio et al., 2005), which assume that capture-recapture data have been collected at a collection of sample locations (``sites''). Capture-recapture models can be fitted with constant parameters (M0), time-specific parameters (Mt), and behavioral responses (Mb). In addition, spatial variation in abundance and capture probability can also be modeled using covariates. unmarked has two functions for fitting capture-recapture models: multinomPois and gmultmix. Both allow for user-defined functions to describe the capture process, and the latter allows for modeling of temporary emigration when data have been collected using the so-called robust design (Kendall et al., 1997; Chandler et al., 2011).},

  abstract = {Quantifying and assessing changes in biological diversity are central aspects of many ecological studies, yet accurate methods of estimating biological diversity from sampling data have been elusive. Hill numbers, or the effective number of species, are increasingly used to characterize the taxonomic, phylogenetic, or functional diversity of an assemblage. However, empirical estimates of Hill numbers, including species richness, tend to be an increasing function of sampling effort and, thus, tend to increase with sample completeness. Integrated curves based on sampling theory that smoothly link rarefaction (interpolation) and prediction (extrapolation) standardize samples on the basis of sample size or sample completeness and facilitate the comparison of biodiversity data. Here we extended previous rarefaction and extrapolation models for species richness (Hill number qD, where q {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0) to measures of taxon diversity incorporating relative abundance (i.e., for any Hill number qD, q . 0) and present a unified approach for both individual-based (abundance) data and samplebased (incidence) data. Using this unified sampling framework, we derive both theoretical formulas and analytic estimators for seamless rarefaction and extrapolation based on Hill numbers. Detailed examples are provided for the first three Hill numbers: q {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0 (species richness), q {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1 (the exponential of Shannon's entropy index), and q {$\frac{1}{4}$} 2 (the inverse of Simpson's concentration index). We developed a bootstrap method for constructing confidence intervals around Hill numbers, facilitating the comparison of multiple assemblages of both rarefied and extrapolated samples. The proposed estimators are accurate for both rarefaction and short-range extrapolation. For long-range extrapolation, the performance of the estimators depends on both the value of q and on the extrapolation range. We tested our methods on simulated data generated from species abundance models and on data from large species inventories. We also illustrate the formulas and estimators using empirical data sets from biodiversity surveys of temperate forest spiders and tropical ants.},

  abstract = {Artificial structures, such as pier pilings, floating pontoons, breakwaters and seawalls are becoming common features of landscape in shallow coastal waters of urbanised areas, in some areas, replacing considerable portions of natural habitats. In Sydney Harbour (NSW, Australia), approximately 50\% of the shore is composed of retaining seawalls or other built habitats. Intertidal seawalls and other similar structures provide new surfaces for colonisation by benthic organisms and therefore provide new intertidal habitats for estuarine animals and plants. They have the potential to supplement natural habitat by supporting natural assemblages, in terms of species composition and relative abundances. Alternatively, artificial structures may support only a subset of natural assemblages, provide habitat for additional species not found on nearby rocky shores, or provide habitat in which some species are consistently missing and additional species found (a combination of the previous two models). Understanding the ecological role that seawalls and other intertidal structures have in urbanised estuaries is important in planning of developments along foreshores. This study compared intertidal assemblages, at each of three different heights among seawalls and nearby horizontal and vertical rocky shores to specifically test the model that seawalls support the same assemblages of animals and plants as are found on natural rocky reefs. Hypotheses from this model were tested at three study locations by measuring abundances of animals and plants in quadrats in replicate sites on each structure. Results indicated that, at mid- and highshore levels, there were frequent differences between assemblages on natural shores and seawalls. In contrast, at lower levels, differences between assemblages on seawalls and vertical rocky reefs were small compared to differences between sites on each structure. Nevertheless, it appeared that the seawalls and rocky shores examined supported a similar suite of species and most differences were due to relative abundances and frequencies of occurrence of the species present. It is, however, premature to conclude that seawalls support similar assemblages to rocky shores until more intensive sampling has been done, specifically to search for rare species. In addition, until we have more knowledge on ecological processes in these assemblages, seawalls should not be considered as surrogates for natural shores.},

Together with the desire or need to control erosion, these have led to increased ``armouring'' of intertidal shorelines, with seawalls, revetments, onshore and offshore groynes and other defence systems, piers and docks replacing natural habitats. Despite the long history of such changes, until relatively recently there had been limited research on the impacts of such alterations to shorelines, especially when compared to research into effects of urbanisation on terrestrial habitats. In addition, most research to date has focussed on the impacts of such changes on the ecological structure of assemblages, i.e. the numbers and types of organisms affected, rather than on ecological processes. With the realisation that most coastal infrastructure cannot be removed, there is now an increasing research effort into ways that infrastructure can be built to meet engineering requirements, but to also increase its value as habitat \textendash{} ecological engineering. In this review, we discuss the major impacts and the experimental research that has been and is being done to build coastal infrastructure in a more biodiversityfriendly manner. Much of the review has focussed on seawalls, which is where most of the experimental work has been done to date. Finally, we raise some concerns about the types of research effort that are still needed and caution against wholesale implementation of what seem like simple remedies, without evidence that they will have the desired effect in the long term.},

In this study, macrofauna within a sub-section of the earlier work were investigated to determine the extent of mesoscale (10\textendash 100 m) variability and new indices of biological community structure. The results were evaluated using univariate (Marine Biotic Index; BI) and multivariate statistical methods (PCA). The computer program Barrier (usually used with genetic data) was also applied to detect ``barriers'' between spatially referenced samples. PCA identified the most significant factor effecting the distribution of the organisms in the study area to be the mud content of the sediment (\% {$<$}63 \textmu m). Communities at sandy sites consisted of suspension feeders and detrital browsers, whilst communities at muddy sites were composed mainly of deposit feeders. The second principal component produced a vector characterized by a contamination gradient. The effects of the sewage discharge appeared to be concentrated at the outfall as it had the highest TOC (10.4\%) content and was the only site to be characterized by the BI as slightly polluted. With the use of the BI and Barrier two gradients were observed in the transition of sites from an unpolluted to a polluted state. These gradients appeared not to follow the flow of the channel as expected (high \% TOC of sites along the channel), and instead extended west and south from the sewage source. In conclusion, weak gradients were observeable; the multiple approaches of BI, PCA and Barrier analyses in concert were able to confirm the sewage dispersion route through the area.},

Using opportunistic collections (1993-2003) of quillback rockfish (n=77; age range of 2-65 yrs.) we first sought to determine whether fish from different sites and regions could be differentiated based on the trace elemental concentrations at the edge of their otoliths (i.e., the chemical record of the fish's recent history). Results of our quadratic discriminant function analysis (QDFA) indicated significant spatial variability for fish collected at relatively large (regions) and small (sites) spatial scales. Specifically, fish collected from regions in 2002 (San Juan Islands and southern Puget Sound) and 2003 (eastern and western Strait of Juan de Fuca) were correctly classified with 100\% and 65\% accuracy (based on jack-knife classification), respectively, while fish collected from sites in 1998 (Mukilteo and Foulweather) were classified with 100\% accuracy. We also investigated whether we could differentiate fish that were collected from different DPS and regions by using elemental concentrations from their whole otolith (which represents environmental information over the lifetime of a fish). Results from the QDFAs indicated relatively high classification success (80\%) when comparing fish collected from either different DPS (i.e., Northern Puget Sound and Puget Sound Proper DPS) or regions (i.e., western and eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca). Findings from this study highlight the value of otolith chemistry in the study of population structure of quillback rockfish in Puget Sound.},

  abstract = {Stochastic (e.g., via species dispersal and ecological drift) and deterministic (e.g., via environmental and biotic filtering) processes can produce diversity patterns related to changes in elevation. However, existing studies have not generally examined these processes within a compressive framework. Stream macroinvertebrates are an important and diverse component of freshwater environments in high-mountain systems. By considering metacommunity-structuring processes using Hierarchical Modelling of Species Communities (HMSC), we investigated changes in taxon richness of stream macroinvertebrates along elevational gradients in streams of the Cangshan mountain range in Southwest China. We found that increasing taxon richness along the elevation gradient until the optimum was reached could be modeled using the integrated actions of full structuring processes within the metacommunity modeling. Consistent increases in taxon-richness along the elevation gradient were able to be modeled considering environmental filtering alone. In addition, the importance of structuring processes on shaping communities decreased along spatial hierarchical-scales (from local habitat to mountainaspect levels). These results suggest that stochastic and biotic-filtering processes can confound environmental filtering in shaping macroinvertebrate communities in high-mountain streams. A comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying elevational biodiversity patterns of riverine communities can be improved through quantitative frameworks (e.g., HMSC) linking metacommunity theory to the real-world systems.},

A decade on, it is instructive to: (i) identify which elements of this often-quoted strategy have proved most useful in practical assessment of community change resulting from pollution impact; and (ii) ask to what extent evolution of techniques in the intervening years has added self-consistency and comprehensiveness to the approach. The pivotal concept has proved to be that of a biologically-relevant definition of similarity of two samples, and its utilization mainly in simple rank form, for example 'sample A is more similar to sample B than it is to sample C . Statistical assumptions about the data are thus minimized and the resulting non-parametric techniques will be of very general applicability. From such a starting point, a unified framework needs to encompass: (i) the display of community patterns through clustering and ordination of samples; (ii) identification of species principally responsible for determining sample groupings; (iii) statistical tests for differences in space and time (multivariate analogues of analysis of variance, based on rank similarities); and (iv) the linking of community differences to patterns in the physical and chemical environment (the latter also dictated by rank similarities between samples). Techniques are described that bring such a framework into place, and areas in which problems remain are identified. Accumulated practical experience with these methods is discussed, in particular applications to marine benthos, and it is concluded tbat they have much to offer practitioners of environmental impact studies on communities.},

We now know that this is not so, and fossil evidence shows clearly that many of the taxa and life-styles that are absent now were previously present. The modern fauna has been shaped by a number of factors, important among which have been oceanographic changes and the onset of Cenozoic glaciation. Sea-water cooling, and periodic fragmentation of ranges and bathymetric shifts in distribution driven by variability in the size and extent of the continental ice cap on Milankovitch frequencies will all have caused both extinction and allopatric speciation.

  abstract = {Measuring the numerical abundance and average body size of individuals of each species in an ecological community's food web reveals new patterns and illuminates old ones. This approach is illustrated using data from the pelagic community of a small lake: Tuesday Lake, Michigan, United States. Body mass varies almost 12 orders of magnitude. Numerical abundance varies almost 10 orders of magnitude. Biomass abundance (average body mass times numerical abundance) varies only 5 orders of magnitude. A new food web graph, which plots species and trophic links in the plane spanned by body mass and numerical abundance, illustrates the nearly inverse relationship between body mass and numerical abundance, as well as the pattern of energy flow in the community. Species with small average body mass occur low in the food web of Tuesday Lake and are numerically abundant. Larger-bodied species occur higher in the food web and are numerically rarer. Average body size explains more of the variation in numerical abundance than does trophic height. The trivariate description of an ecological community by using the food web, average body sizes, and numerical abundance includes many well studied bivariate and univariate relationships based on subsets of these three variables.

  abstract = {Mussels are important ecosystem engineers that have significant impacts on the ecology of the seafloor. In this study, we attempt to characterize and explain infaunal and epifaunal abundance patterns across scales in a spatially complex, intertidal, soft-bottom habitat: beds of the semi-infaunal mussel, Mytilus edulis. We used univariate and multivariate analyses in a nested sampling design at three locations in eastern Maine to show the relationships between environmental and macrofaunal assemblage variables. The results support the hypotheses that: 1) environmental and macrofaunal assemblage variables vary widely across spatial scales and exhibit maximum variance at different spatial scales; 2) abundance and diversity patterns of macrofauna are linked to spatial variation in environmental variables in the form of biogenic structure (live mussels and mussel shell hash), terrestrially-derived gravel, and, to a lesser degree, the proportion of silt-clay in the sediment; and 3) epifauna are generally positively correlated with hard-substrate features such as live mussels and gravel, and negatively correlated with the silt-clay content of the sediment, although the latter relationships were not strong. On the other hand, the results did not support the hypotheses that: 4) most infauna, specifically those with free-swimming larvae, are negatively correlated with live mussels and siltclay proportion; instead, they were often positively correlated with live mussels and had weak, insignificant correlations with silt-clay; and 5) infauna without free-swimming larvae are positively correlated with live mussels and silt-clay proportion; instead, they showed some positive correlations with live mussels, but a mix of weak, insignificant correlations with silt-clay. Thus, mussel beds had a variety of scale-dependent relationships, both positive and negative, with each of the macrofaunal groups. The results show that biogenic structure in the form of live mussels and mussel shell hash is important in this system, as is terrestrial gravel, and that these variables are more important than silt-clay content for the macrofaunal assemblage. Mussel beds play an important role in regulating macrofaunal diversity in soft-bottom habitats, and their effects vary across spatial scales.},

The age composition also differed among habitats, with complex sites supporting a greater proportion of older fish ({$>$} 1+ yr). The relative importance of recruitment and postrecruitment processes in determining these patterns was evaluated by monitoring the abundance, survival, growth and movement oftwo separate cohorts of juveniles in habitats of different complexity. The demographic data were based on records of individually recognised fish monitored from time of recruitment in permanent quadrats. Despite high temporal and spatial variability in the intensity and distribution of recruitment between years, adult F. variumwere highlydependent on early postrecruitment mortality. Greater rates of early iuveni!e \textasciitilde{} o \textasciitilde{} t y were experienced within habitats of !ow comple\texttimes i\textasciitilde y. The greatest impact of mortality hi structuring spatial patterns occurred within the first week at\textasciitilde er settlement. Seasonal peaks in movement may have partially contributed to changes in patterns of distribution between habitats. The effects of habitat on growth were less clear, although there was a trend for growth to be better within habitats of high topographic complexity. The effect of topographic complexity on survivorship of juveniles was examined using a manipulative experiment which increased the complexityof simple habitats and reduced the complexity of heterogeneous habitats. Recruitment occurred roughly evenly across all treatments. Low complexity treatments suffered 100\% mortality compared to only 13\% in high complexity treatments. The demography of natural populations and the subsequent experiment suggest that differences in the abundance of adult F. variumbetween habitats can be attributed essentially to the early failure of juveniles to survive in large numbers in low complexity habitats.},

In recent years the efficacy of historically successful treatments has been on the decline. As such, a new management strategy for controlling lice infections is a high priority for the salmon farming industry. In this study, we tested the ability of three orally administered immunostimulants to decrease the number of lice successfully infecting Atlantic salmon post-smolts. It was found that the {$\beta$}-glucan (ProVale) fed group actually maintained more sea lice than did the control group (24\% increase). However, both the CpG ODN (31\textendash 46\%) and AllBrew NuPro (11\textendash 31\%) fed groups showed decreased infection levels when compared to the control group. Histopathological and differential gene expression analyses indicate that localized and systemic inflammatory mechanisms may be transiently altered by these immunostimulatory feeds and may result in increased host resistance to sea lice.},

  abstract = {Predatory release has long been considered a potential contributor to population outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish (CoTS; Acanthaster spp.). This has initiated extensive searches for potentially important predators that can consume large numbers of CoTS at high rates, which are also vulnerable to over-fishing or reef degradation. Herein, we review reported predators of CoTS and assess the potential for these organisms to exert significant mortality, and thereby prevent and/or moderate CoTS outbreaks. In all, 80 species of coral reef organisms (including fishes, and motile and sessile invertebrates) are reported to predate on CoTS gametes (three species), larvae (17 species), juveniles (15 species), adults (18 species) and/or opportunistically feed on injured (10 species) or moribund (42 species) individuals within reef habitats. It is clear however, that predation on early life-history stages has been understudied, and there are likely to be many more species of reef fishes and/or sessile invertebrates that readily consume CoTS gametes and/or larvae. Given the number and diversity of coral reef species that consume Acanthaster spp., most of which (e.g., Arothron pufferfishes) are not explicitly targeted by reef-based fisheries, links between overfishing and CoTS outbreaks remain equivocal. There is also no single species that appears to have a disproportionate role in regulating CoTS populations. Rather, the collective consumption of CoTS by multiple different species and at different life-history stages is likely to suppress the local abundance of CoTS, and thereby mediate the severity of outbreaks. It is possible therefore, that general degradation of reef ecosystems and corresponding declines in biodiversity and productivity, may contribute to increasing incidence or severity of outbreaks of Acanthaster spp. However, it seems unlikely that predatory release in and of itself could account for initial onset of CoTS outbreaks. In conclusion, reducing anthropogenic stressors that reduce the abundance and/or diversity of potential predatory species represents a ``no regrets'' management strategy, but will need to be used in conjunction with other management strategies to prevent, or reduce the occurrence, of CoTS outbreaks.},

Species richness and abundance are commonly used to generate complex diversity indices that are dependent on the quality of these estimates. As such, there is a long-\-standing interest in the development of monitoring techniques, their ability to adequately assess species diversity, and the implications for generated indices. To determine the ability of substratum community assessment methods to capture species diversity, we evaluated four methods: photo quadrat, point intercept, random subsampling, and full quadrat assessments. Species density, abundance, richness, Shannon diversity, and Simpson diversity were then calculated for each method. We then conducted a method validation at a subset of locations to serve as an indication for how well each method captured the totality of the diversity present. Density, richness, Shannon diversity, and Simpson diversity estimates varied between methods, despite assessments occurring at the same locations, with photo quadrats detecting the lowest estimates and full quadrat assessments the highest. Abundance estimates were consistent among methods. Sample-\-based rarefaction and extrapolation curves indicated that differences between Hill numbers (richness, Shannon diversity, and Simpson diversity) were significant in the majority of cases, and coverage-\-based rarefaction and extrapolation curves confirmed that these dissimilarities were due to differences between the methods, not the sample completeness. Method validation highlighted the inability of the tested methods to capture the totality of the diversity present, while further supporting the notion of extrapolating abundances. Our results highlight the need for consistency across research methods, the advantages of utilizing multiple diversity indices, and potential concerns and considerations when comparing data from multiple sources.},

Indigenous communities in North America pioneered numerous marine resource management strategies to ensure food security and support thriving economies, which have been active throughout the Northwest Coast of North America for over 14~000 years. Developed to increase shellfish productivity, clam gardens have been active for millennia. The diverse infaunal communities within these ecosystems can act as indicators of habitat alterations and provide an opportunity to study ecological community responses to seascapes shaped by millennia-old resource management structures. To determine how community structure differs between clam gardens and unmodified areas, we assessed infaunal diversity and density between intertidal mudflats, sandflats, and clam gardens. Differences in community composition were found among site types, with certain taxa, including culturally important species increasing within clam gardens. Per cent similarity analyses indicated that infaunal communities were more dissimilar among, than within site types. Furthermore, regression trees indicated that increases in diversity and density were closely correlated with the amount of shell and gravel within each habitat, which are associated with clam garden function and management practices. Species-specific and environmental responses to clam gardens indicate that human modifications in nearshore habitats created novel and distinct types of soft sediment communities.},

  abstract = {Pacific Northwest Indigenous communities historically managed terrestrial and marine environments to increase the productivity and access of traditional foods. Sea gardens, also called clam gardens, were an Indigenous aquaculture method that increased traditional food habitat for targeted food species such as bivalves. This study utilized fatty acid biomarker analysis alongside stable isotopic analysis with bivalve condition indices of traditionally harvested littleneck clams (Leukoma staminea) to investigate dietary and trophic differences between sea gardens and non-walled beaches in Kanish Bay, Quadra Island, British Columbia. We utilized non-metric multidimensional scaling, distance-based redundancy analysis (db-RDA), and Bayesian three-source isotopic mixing models to examine impacts of environmental drivers on bivalve dietary composition and condition at four sea garden sites and four non-walled sites. Bivalve tissue saturated fatty acids (sum SFAs) showed statistical significance (Mann-Whitney U-Test, W = 3447, P {$\leq$} 0.01), indicating that sea garden clams ({$\overline x$} = 34.96; SD = 7.56) had higher mean relative percent areas of SFAs compared to nonwalled sites ({$\overline x$} = 31.76; 7.71). Bivalve monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) showed statistical significance (Mann-Whitney U-Test, W = 1202, P {$\leq$} 0.01, a = 0.05), indicating sea garden clams ({$\overline x$} = 3.48; SD = 3.78) had lower mean relative percent areas of MUFAs compared to those in non-walled sites ({$\overline x$} = 6.97; SD = 5.90). Sea garden bivalves were found to feed at a higher trophic level, with a slimmer dietary range, compared to non-walled clams. Both dietary marker differences and differentiated trophic positioning suggest decreased physiological stressors impacting feeding of bivalves, differences in dietary particulate intake, or a combination of both occurring at sea garden sites compared to non-walled sites. Correlations within a db-RDA indicate that bivalves with high body condition indices at sea garden sites were benefiting from decreased stress related to favorable salinity and oxygen parameters, which positively impacted bivalve feeding and respiration. Observed trophic niche differences and fatty acid differences would also be explained by this suggested mechanism. We conclude that partial trophic shifts and fatty acid changes of sea garden L. staminea bivalves are consistent with stress-alleviated bivalve responses, and match correlated variables in our db-RDA. Trophic niche differences and fatty acid shifts between sea gardens and non-walled sites should be further explored by using a quantitative method to identify sea gardens from nonwalled sites in addition to established field verification methods.},

Sea gardens, also called clam gardens, were an Indigenous aquaculture method that increased traditional food habitat for targeted food species such as bivalves. This study utilized fatty acid biomarker analysis alongside stable isotopic analysis with bivalve condition indices of traditionally harvested littleneck clams (Leukoma staminea) to investigate dietary and trophic differences between sea gardens and non-walled beaches in Kanish Bay, Quadra Island, British Columbia. We utilized non-metric multidimensional scaling, distance-based redundancy analysis (db-RDA), and Bayesian three-source isotopic mixing models to examine impacts of environmental drivers on bivalve dietary composition and condition at four sea garden sites and four non-walled sites. Bivalve tissue saturated fatty acids (sum SFAs) showed statistical significance (Mann-Whitney U-Test, W = 3447, P {$\leq$} 0.01), indicating that sea garden clams ({$\overline x$} = 34.96; SD = 7.56) had higher mean relative percent areas of SFAs compared to nonwalled sites ({$\overline x$} = 31.76; 7.71). Bivalve monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) showed statistical significance (Mann-Whitney U-Test, W = 1202, P {$\leq$} 0.01, a = 0.05), indicating sea garden clams ({$\overline x$} = 3.48; SD = 3.78) had lower mean relative percent areas of MUFAs compared to those in non-walled sites ({$\overline x$} = 6.97; SD = 5.90). Sea garden bivalves were found to feed at a higher trophic level, with a slimmer dietary range, compared to non-walled clams. Both dietary marker differences and differentiated trophic positioning suggest decreased physiological stressors impacting feeding of bivalves, differences in dietary particulate intake, or a combination of both occurring at sea garden sites compared to non-walled sites. Correlations within a db-RDA indicate that bivalves with high body condition indices at sea garden sites were benefiting from decreased stress related to favorable salinity and oxygen parameters, which positively impacted bivalve feeding and respiration. Observed trophic niche differences and fatty acid differences would also be explained by this suggested mechanism. We conclude that partial trophic shifts and fatty acid changes of sea garden L. staminea bivalves are consistent with stress-alleviated bivalve responses, and match correlated variables in our db-RDA. Trophic niche differences and fatty acid shifts between sea gardens and non-walled sites should be further explored by using a quantitative method to identify sea gardens from nonwalled sites in addition to established field verification methods.},

Random forests (RF) is a new and powerful statistical classifier that is well established in other disciplines but is relatively unknown in ecology. Advantages of RF compared to other statistical classifiers include (1) very high classification accuracy; (2) a novel method of determining variable importance; (3) ability to model complex interactions among predictor variables; (4) flexibility to perform several types of statistical data analysis, including regression, classification, survival analysis, and unsupervised learning; and (5) an algorithm for imputing missing values. We compared the accuracies of RF and four other commonly used statistical classifiers using data on invasive plant species presence in Lava Beds National Monument, California, USA, rare lichen species presence in the Pacific Northwest, USA, and nest sites for cavity nesting birds in the Uinta Mountains, Utah, USA. We observed high classification accuracy in all applications as measured by cross-validation and, in the case of the lichen data, by independent test data, when comparing RF to other common classification methods. We also observed that the variables that RF identified as most important for classifying invasive plant species coincided with expectations based on the literature.},

The species that we target are thus far in considerable decline; however, predators in the wild generally achieve a balance with their prey populations such that both persist. Darimont               et al.               found several specific differences between how humans and other predatory species target prey populations (see the Perspective by Worm). In marine environments, for example, we regularly prey on other predator species. These differences may contribute to our much larger ecological impact when compared with other predators.

We compared patterns of predation by contemporary hunters and fishers with those of other predators that compete over shared prey (terrestrial mammals and marine fishes). Our global survey (2125 estimates of annual finite exploitation rate) revealed that humans kill adult prey, the reproductive capital of populations, at much higher median rates than other predators (up to 14 times higher), with particularly intense exploitation of terrestrial carnivores and fishes. Given this competitive dominance, impacts on predators, and other unique predatory behavior, we suggest that humans function as an unsustainable ``super predator,'' which\textemdash unless additionally constrained by managers\textemdash will continue to alter ecological and evolutionary processes globally.},

Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new techniques to efficiently restore degraded seagrass meadows. Here we tested the efficacy and efficiency of a new technique of seagrass transplant (Cymodocea nodosa) using biodegradable containers. We investigated the effects of this transplant technique in the Adriatic Sea comparing the transplanted seagrass meadows with adjacent donor seagrass meadows and bare sediments used as control. We assessed the recovery rates and the ecological implications of this transplant on key ecosystems functions, including the biomass and detritus provision to local biological communities, and the effects on the biodiversity of the associated benthic fauna. Our results show that this restoration technique was successful, enabling the seagrass survival (approximately 30\%) even in high-energy conditions occurring in winter. The sediments hosting the transplanted seagrasses showed an increase of trophic availability and of rates of organic matter cycling. Despite this, 1 year after the transplant, the abundance and biodiversity of meiofaunal assemblages in the restored seagrasses were still lower than in donor seagrass meadows. These results indicate that the restoration process of seagrass meadows can take a long time, and that a multilevel approach (including the analysis of biodiversity and of the sedimentary processes and biogeochemical cycles) is needed to assess the success of restoration actions in these habitats.},

Amongst all the species, C. militaris is considered as the oldest source of some useful chemical constituents. Besides their popular applications for tonic medicine by the all stairs of the community, the constituents of C. militaris are now used extensively in modern systems of medicine. The current survey records the mysterious potentials of C. militaris are boosting up the present herbal treatments, as well as gearing up the green pharmacy revolution, in order to create a friendly environment with reasonable safety. Evidence showed that the active principles of C. militaris are beneficial to act as pro-sexual, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant/ anti-aging, anti-tumour/anti-cancer/anti-leukemic, anti-proliferative, anti-metastatic, immunomodulatory, anti-microbial, anti-bacterial, anti-viral, anti-fungal, anti-protozoal, insecticidal, larvicidal, anti-fibrotic, steroidogenic, hypoglacaemic, hypolipidaemic, antiangiogenetic, anti-diabetic, anti-HIV, anti-malarial, anti-fatigue, neuroprotective, liverprotective, reno-protective as well as pneumo-protective, let alone their other synergistic activities, which let it be marketable in the western countries as over-the-counter medicine. A number of culture techniques for this mushroom have been noticed, for example, storage/stock culture, pre-culture, popular/indigenous culture (spawn culture, husked rice culture and saw dust culture) and, special/laboratory culture (shaking culture, submerged culture, surface liquid culture and continuous/repeated batch culture). The prospects for herbal biotechnology regarding drug discovery using C. militaris delivering what it has promised are high, as the technology is now extremely more powerful than before. This study chiefly highlights the medicinal uses of the mushroom C. militaris including its culture techniques, also aiming to draw sufficient attention of the researchers to the frontier research needs in this context.},

We compared the results of four biotic indices on the various available datasets: Shannon-Wiener H diversity, AMBI and BO2A, which divide the species into Ecological Groups, and ITI, which divides the species into trophic groups, and the agreement of Best Professional Judgement (BPJ) on the assessment of ecological conditions. Benthic indicators as ``sentinel species'', which is a particular species that by its presence or its relative abundance warns of possible unbalances in the surrounding environment or distortions in community functions, was also tested. Indicators, BPJ and opportunist sentinel species gave similar ECoQS for the different sampling sites. We discuss the use of Biological Indicators as `objective' or `subjective' alternatives for assessing soft-bottom communities, and propose to employ simple methods such as BPJ and taxonomy sufficiency in such diagnostic approaches.},

Key information to underpin management actions and conservation planning includes relationships between species assemblages and environmental gradients, and information on species distributions. We conducted a subtidal biodiversity assessment of surface-\-dwelling subtidal molluscs in eight a priori defined habitat types using underwater visual censuses to quantitatively explore relationships between molluscan assemblages, and their correlation with benthic habitats and abiotic variables. In addition, variations in diversity were examined for two key habitat types (areas dominated by Dendronephthya australis and by filter feeders) over a period of 15 months to examine temporal change. We found that molluscs form distinct assemblages within subtidal habitats, but that assemblages within key habitats show inherent temporal variability. Regional (gamma) diversity of molluscs was found to result from a combination of: (i) within habitat alpha diversity, which increased with habitat complexity; (ii) between habitat beta diversity, with significant differences in molluscan assemblages amongst habitats with differing benthic growth, substrate type, and depth; and (iii) temporal beta diversity, with significant changes detected in molluscan assemblages over time. The results demonstrate how habitats and abiotic variables (principally depth and substrate type) combine to contribute to molluscan biodiversity in temperate estuaries, and illustrate the value of these factors as surrogates for surface-\-dwelling subtidal molluscs in conservation planning.},

  abstract = {Aggregations of wild fish were counted around 9 floating sea-cage fish farms along a 300 km stretch of the Spanish coastline in the south-western Mediterranean Sea. Each fish farm cultivated Sparus aurata and Dicentrarchus labrax in 6 to 16 floating sea cages between 10 m and 7.4 km from the coast. During September and October 2001, assemblages of fish were counted on 3 separate days at each of 9 farms. Six 5 min rapid visual counts using SCUBA and covering 11 250 m3 were performed within each farm complex and at open water control sites 200 m distant from farms. Abundance (52 to 2837\texttimes ), biomass (2.8 to 1126 \texttimes ) and number of species (1.6 to 14 \texttimes ) were greater in fish farm counts than control counts at all locations. Twenty-seven species were recorded at fish farms, with 2 families, Sparidae (12 species) and Carangidae (4 species), being particularly abundant. Over 85\% of farm-associated fish were of adult size. Assemblages of wild fish differed greatly between farms separated by 10s to 100s of km, although there was some evidence to suggest that similar assemblages occur at farms separated by 100s of m to several km. Abundance, biomass and number of species differed among fish farms, with all 3 variables negatively correlated with distance of farms from shore and positively correlated with size of farms. Limited variability of wild fish assemblages and abundance of the dominant taxa at each farm among times sampled indicated some degree of temporal stability on a scale of several weeks. Due to the strong aggregative effect of fish farms, possible residence of fishes for periods of weeks to months and the prohibition of fishing within farm leasehold areas, we suggest that coastal sea-cage fish farms may act as small (up to 160 000 m2), pelagic marine protected areas (MPAs). Furthermore, at farms where wild fish are abundant, ecological interactions that may influence both wild fish stocks and the impact of farms must be considered.},

Among those practices that have escaped the attention of anthropologists until recently is the traditional management of intertidal clam beds, which Northwest Coast peoples have enhanced through techniques such as selective harvests, the removal of shells and other debris, and the mechanical aeration of the soil matrix. In some cases, harvesters also removed stones or even created stone revetments that served to laterally expand sediments suitable for clam production into previously unusable portions of the tidal zone. This article presents the only account of these activities, their motivations, and their outcomes, based on the first-hand knowledge of a traditional practitioner, Kwakwaka'wakw Clan Chief Kwaxistalla Adam Dick, trained in these techniques by elders raised in the nineteenth century when clam Bgardening\^ was still widely practiced.},

Capture fisheries have been stabilized at about 90 million metric tons since the late 1980s, whereas aquaculture increased from 12 million metric tons in 1985 to 45 million metric tons by 2004. Aquaculture includes species at any trophic level that are grown for domestic consumption or export. Aquaculture has some positive impacts on biodiversity; for example, cultured seafood can reduce pressure on overexploited wild stocks, stocked organisms may enhance depleted stocks, aquaculture often boosts natural production and species diversity, and employment in aquaculture may replace more destructive resource uses. On the negative side, species that escape from aquaculture can become invasive in areas where they are nonnative, effluents from aquaculture can cause eutrophication, ecologically sensitive land may be converted for aquaculture use, aquaculture species may consume increasingly scarce fish meal, and aquaculture species may transmit diseases to wild fish. Most likely, aquaculture will continue to grow at significant rates through 2025, and will remain the most rapidly increasing food production system.},

A co-management conflict has arisen from an increase of hunting quotas in January 2005 for Inuit living in the Baffin Bay and Western Hudson Bay polar bear population areas. The quotas were based on Inuit observations and their conclusion that these polar bear populations had increased. Scientific information suggests that climate change has concentrated polar bears in areas where humans are more likely to encounter them, but that the populations are in decline as a result of overhunting and climate-change effects on demographic rates. During consultations with wildlife managers and through other interviews in 2005, Inuit indicated their lack of support for quota reductions. Discussions with Inuit reveal two categories of problems that, though couched in the polar bear management issue, involve the co-management system and the integration of Inuit and scientific knowledge more generally. The first relates to direct observations of the environment by both Inuit and scientists and the synthesis of such information. The second relates to Inuit conceptualizations of human-animal relationships and the incorporation of scientific studies and management into that relationship. These problems reveal that differences between Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit and scientific knowledge are not fully understood and accounted for within the co-management system and that the system does not effectively integrate Inuit cultural views into management.},

Adult varnish clams from 2 populations were collected in British Columbia, Canada throughout the spawning season to determine sex, fecundity, and timing of spawning. Adult varnish clams were also spawned in the laboratory and the larvae reared at a range of temperatures and salinities. The highest larval growth rates were observed in the 20\textdegree C and 20 psu treatments. Planktonic duration ranged from 3 to potentially 8 wk, with higher temperatures and salinities resulting in a shorter planktonic phase. Larvae reared at 9\textdegree C, and at 10 and 15 psu, grew slowly and survived for a minimum of 1 mo but did not reach metamorphosis. These results indicate that varnish clam larvae have a wide range of salinity and temperature tolerances, but grow optimally at warmer temperatures and higher salinities. Varnish clams have comparable larval environmental tolerances and spawning duration to co-occurring bivalves. However, their fecundity appears to be slightly higher and they reach sexual maturity earlier, potentially providing an advantage in establishing new populations. The lengthy planktonic phase, combined with favourable oceanographic circulation patterns, has contributed to the rapid dispersal and geographic range expansion of the varnish clam in the Northeast Pacific.},

In this study, the invasion of the varnish clam (Nuttallia obscurata) in British Columbia, Canada, is investigated using a matrix modeling approach to identify the life history characteristics most crucial for population growth and to investigate population differences. Mark-recapture analyses and field collections from 2003 to 2004 were used to determine individual growth, survival rates, and fecundity for two sites. A multi-state matrix model was used to determine population growth rates and to conduct sensitivity and elasticity analyses. A life table response experiment was also used to determine what life history stage contributed most to observed differences in population growth rates. Population survey data were used in conjunction with the matrix model to determine plausible recruitment levels and to investigate recruitment scenarios. Both populations are currently declining but are likely sustainable because of the pulsed nature of large recruitment events. Survival of larger clams ({$>$}40 mm) is the most important for population growth based on elasticity and sensitivity analyses. Adult survival also had the largest influence on observed differences between site specific population growth rates. The two populations studied differed in recruitment dynamics; one experiencing annual recruitment with higher post-settlement mortality and the other, episodic recruitment and lower post-settlement mortality. The most influential factor for the successful invasion of the varnish clam appears to be survival of the larger size classes. Therefore, any process that decreases adult survival (e.g., pr?dation, commercial harvest) will have the greatest impact on population growth.

Using the most comprehensive dataset of fish diversity and abundance, encompassing over 4,500 surveys from nearshore habitats around the world, we show that biodiversity is among the strongest predictors of reef fish community biomass, comparable in importance to global temperature gradients and human impacts. Importantly, diverse fish communities were more resistant to rising and variable temperature, suggesting that high biodiversity also buffers against changing climate. Maintaining taxonomically and functionally diverse fish communities can thus stabilize fisheries' yields in a changing ocean.           ,              Fishes are the most diverse group of vertebrates, play key functional roles in aquatic ecosystems, and provide protein for a billion people, especially in the developing world. Those functions are compromised by mounting pressures on marine biodiversity and ecosystems. Because of its economic and food value, fish biomass production provides an unusually direct link from biodiversity to critical ecosystem services. We used the Reef Life Survey's global database of 4,556 standardized fish surveys to test the importance of biodiversity to fish production relative to 25 environmental drivers. Temperature, biodiversity, and human influence together explained 47\% of the global variation in reef fish biomass among sites. Fish species richness and functional diversity were among the strongest predictors of fish biomass, particularly for the large-bodied species and carnivores preferred by fishers, and these biodiversity effects were robust to potentially confounding influences of sample abundance, scale, and environmental correlations. Warmer temperatures increased biomass directly, presumably by raising metabolism, and indirectly by increasing diversity, whereas temperature variability reduced biomass. Importantly, diversity and climate interact, with biomass of diverse communities less affected by rising and variable temperatures than species-poor communities. Biodiversity thus buffers global fish biomass from climate change, and conservation of marine biodiversity can stabilize fish production in a changing ocean.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new and simple method to find indicator species and species assemblages characterizing groups of sites. The novelty of our approach lies in the way we combine a species relative abundance with its relative frequency of occurrence in the various groups of sites. This index is maximum when all individuals of a species are found in a single group of sites and when the species occurs in all sites of that group; it is a symmetric indicator. The statistical significance of the species indicator values is evaluated using a randomization procedure. Contrary to Twinspan, our indicator index for a given species is independent of the other species relative abundances, and there is no need to use pseudospecies. The new method identifies indicator species for typologies of species relev\'es obtained by any hierarchical or nonhierarchical classification procedure; its use is independent of the classification method. Because indicator species give ecological meaning to groups of sites, this method provides criteria to compare typologies, to identify where to stop dividing clusters into subsets, and to point out the main levels in a hierarchical classification of sites. Species can be grouped on the basis of their indicator values for each clustering level, the heterogeneous nature of species assemblages observed in any one site being well preserved. Such assemblages are usually a mixture of eurytopic (higher level) and stenotopic species (characteristic of lower level clusters). The species assemblage approach demonstrates the importance of the ``sampled patch size,'' i.e., the diversity of sampled ecological combinations, when we compare the frequencies of core and satellite species. A new way to present species\textendash site tables, accounting for the hierarchical relationships among species, is proposed. A large data set of carabid beetle distributions in open habitats of Belgium is used as a case study to illustrate the new method.},

Food containing lyophilized extracts of these plants as 0.1 and 1\% was used at a rate of 2\% of body weight per day for three weeks. At the end of the experimental period, various parameters of non-specific defence mechanisms, including extracellular and intracellular respiratory burst activities, phagocytosis in blood leukocytes and total plasma protein level were examined.

However, they are little used, at least in any formal way, in environmental impact assessment (EIA). This is puzzling because EIA is a process specifically dedicated to exploring options for more-sustainable (i.e., less environmentally damaging) futures. In this paper, we review the state of the art associated with scenarios and scenario analysis, and describe two areas where scenario analysis could be particularly helpful in EIA: (a) in defining future developments for cumulative effects assessment; and (b) in considering the influence of contextual change \textendash{} e.g. climate change \textendash{} on impact forecasts for specific projects. We conclude by encouraging EIA practitioners to learn about the promise of scenario-based analysis and implement scenario-based methods so that EIA can become more effective in fostering sustainable development.},

  abstract = {Aquaculture is viewed as a potential mechanism to meet the growing demand for seafood around the world. The future of bivalve shellfish aquaculture in the U.S. hinges on sustainable practices on the part of industry and a more consistent regulatory regime. Bivalve shellfish aquaculture is a recent practice relative to its history in other countries, beginning in the late 1800s along the U.S. West Coast where it is now well established with farm raised product utilizing land-based hatcheries and grow-out directly in numerous estuaries. Bivalve shellfish aquaculture can be viewed as a disturbance which modifies the estuarine system in three ways: 1) changes in material processes \textemdash{} bivalves process food and produce wastes; 2) addition of physical structure \textemdash{} aquaculture introduces the cultured organisms and in some cases a physical anchoring structure; and 3) pulse disturbances like harvest and bed maintenance disturb sediments, remove species in addition to the cultured organisms themselves, and change resource or habitat availability. In U.S. West Coast estuaries, water column and sediment nutrient concentrations are relatively high and influenced by large tidal exchange and proximity to deeper nearshore ocean waters where upwelling controls production during summer months. Bivalves are unlikely to influence material processes except at local bed scales in these systems, although estuary-wide effects could appear as the fraction of cultured area rises or in poorly flushed bays. Bivalve culture clearly modifies estuarine habitat at local community and at landscape scales and effects are most often evaluated against existing structured habitat in the form of submerged aquatic vegetation. Individual activities act as pulse disturbances and the recovery of eelgrass (Zostera marina) to predisturbance levels is variable (b 2 to N 5 years). The extent of disturbance depends on the aquaculture practice and the distribution of eelgrass reflects a balance of space competition, pulse disturbance and recovery, and is therefore at dynamic equilibrium on aquaculture beds. Structure provided by aquaculture appears functionally similar to eelgrass for small benthic infauna and mobile epibenthic fauna while use of aquaculture as habitat by larger more mobile invertebrates and fish depends on mobility and varies with lifehistory stage and taxon being evaluated. Scale seems a very important management consideration and further research at estuarine landscape scales, especially for habitat use by important invertebrates and fish, may prove useful in designing and implementing best management practices. Though local and short term effects from aquaculture are clearly evident in U.S. West Coast estuaries, bivalve aquaculture does not remove area from the estuary or degrade water quality like other anthropogenic influences, and thus has not been implicated in shifts to alternate states or reduced adaptive capacity of the larger ecological system.},

We quantitatively assessed 19 glass sponge reefs in the Salish Sea for live reef-building sponge cover and biodiversity, explored potential drivers behind variation observed among reefs, and quantified individual and collective roles the reefs play in filtration and carbon removal. The reefs support diverse and abundant communities of invertebrates and fish, with 115 unique taxonomic groups observed. Sponge cover varied widely between reefs: percent live reef-building sponge cover ranged from 0.2 to 17.5\% and proportion of live reef habitat category ranged from 0.2 to 92\%. These differences were predominantly driven by the seabed terrain characteristics such as seafloor rugosity, curvature, and depth; human pressure measures explored in this study - density of anthropogenic objects and fishing footprint over the past 17 years \textendash{} did not mask the natural influence of seabed terrain. The difference in sponge cover between the reefs led to wide variation in ecosystem function with individual reefs processing between 465 and 47,300 L/m2 per day. Collectively, each day the 19 reefs filter 1.04 \texttimes{} 1011 L of water which corresponds to 1\% of the total water volume in Strait of Georgia and Howe Sound combined. The reefs remove up to 1 g of carbon per m2 per day, comparable to carbon sequestration rates reported for terrestrial old growth forests and to ``blue carbon'' sequestration rates by marine vegetation. Implications for sponge reef conservation and monitoring are discussed.},

We present two highly resolved intertidal and nearshore food webs for the Sanak Archipelago in the eastern Aleutian Islands and use them to compare trophic roles of prehistoric humans to other species. We find that the native Aleut people played distinctive roles as super-generalist and highly-omnivorous consumers closely connected to other species. Although the human population was positioned to have strong effects, arrival and presence of Aleut people in the Sanak Archipelago does not appear associated with long-term extinctions. We simulated food web dynamics to explore to what degree introducing a species with trophic roles like those of an Aleut forager, and allowing for variable strong feeding to reflect use of hunting technology, is likely to trigger extinctions. Potential extinctions decreased when an invading omnivorous super-generalist consumer focused strong feeding on decreasing fractions of its possible resources. This study presents the first assessment of the structural roles of humans as consumers within complex ecological networks, and potential impacts of those roles and feeding behavior on associated extinctions.},

  abstract = {Temperate nearshore reefs along the Pacific coast of North America are highly valuable to commercial and recreational fisheries yet comprise a small fraction of the seabed. Monitoring fisheries resources in this region is difficult; high-relief structural complexity and adverse sea conditions have led to a paucity of information on temperate reef species assemblage patterns. Reliable, inexpensive tools and methods for monitoring are needed, as many traditional tools are both logistically complicated and expensive, limiting the frequency of their implementation over a large scale. Video drop cameras of varying designs have previously been employed to estimate fish abundance and distribution. We surveyed a nearshore rocky reef off the northern Oregon coast with a video lander (a video camera mounted on a landing platform so it can be dropped to the seafloor) over the spring and winter of 2011. We designed a 272-point systematic grid to document the species assemblage and the distribution and habitat associations of the reef species, including two overfished rockfishes: Canary Rockfish Sebastes pinniger and Yelloweye Rockfish Sebastes ruberrimus. Species assemblages differed significantly across the reef by depth and by season for the outer part of the reef. Well-defined habitat associations existed for many species; Canary Rockfish were associated with complex moderate-relief habitat types such as large boulders and small boulders, while Yelloweye Rockfish were associated with high-relief habitats like vertical walls. Species associations were evaluated pairwise to identify nearshore complexes. We compared our site with five exploratory reef sites off the central Oregon coast and found that nearshore reefs differed from our site, while offshore reefs were more similar. Video landers provide a solution to the need for increased sampling of temperate reef systems that are subject to difficult conditions and can contribute to habitat mapping, fish abundance indices, and fish assemblage information for monitoring and management of fisheries resources.},

Knowledge of species fluctuations is particularly inadequate in the marine realm4. Here we assess the population trends of 1,057 common shallow reef species from multiple phyla at 1,636 sites around Australia over the past decade. Most  populations decreased over this period, including many tropical fishes, temperate  invertebrates (particularly echinoderms) and southwestern Australian macroalgae,  whereas coral populations remained relatively stable. Population declines typically followed heatwave years, when local water temperatures were more than 0.5\,\textdegree C above temperatures in 2008. Following heatwaves5,6, species abundances generally tended to decline near warm range edges, and increase near cool range edges. More than 30\% of shallow invertebrate species in cool latitudes exhibited high extinction risk, with rapidly declining populations trapped by deep ocean barriers, preventing poleward retreat as temperatures rise. Greater conservation effort is needed to safeguard temperate marine ecosystems, which are disproportionately threatened and include  species with deep evolutionary roots. Fundamental among such efforts, and broader societal needs to efficiently adapt to interacting anthropogenic and natural pressures, is greatly expanded monitoring of species'~population trends.},

Size spectra are often used as ecosystem indicators of marine systems. They have been fitted to data from various sources, including groundfish trawl surveys, visual surveys of fish in kelp forests and coral reefs, sediment samples of benthic invertebrates and satellite remote sensing of chlorophyll. 2. Over the past decades, several methods have been used to fit size spectra to data. We document eight such methods, demonstrating their commonalities and differences. Seven methods use linear regression (of which six require binning of data), while the eighth uses maximum likelihood estimation. We test the accuracy of the methods on simulated data. 3. We demonstrate that estimated size-spectrum slopes are not always comparable between the seven regressionbased methods because such methods are not estimating the same parameter. We find that four of the eight tested methods can sometimes give reasonably accurate estimates of the exponent of the individual size distribution (which is related to the slope of the size spectrum). However, sensitivity analyses find that maximum likelihood estimation is the only method that is consistently accurate, and the only one that yields reliable confidence intervals for the exponent. 4. We therefore recommend the use of maximum likelihood estimation when fitting size spectra. To facilitate this, we provide documented R code for fitting and plotting results. This should provide consistency in future studies and improve the quality of any resulting advice to ecosystem managers. In particular, the calculation of reliable confidence intervals will allow proper consideration of uncertainty when making management decisions.},

  abstract = {Size spectra are recommended tools for detecting the response of marine communities to fishing or to management measures. A size spectrum succinctly describes how a property, such as abundance or biomass, varies with body size in a community. Required data are often collected in binned form, such as numbers of individuals in 1 cm length bins. Numerous methods have been employed to fit size spectra, but most give biased estimates when tested on simulated data, and none account for the data's bin structure (breakpoints of bins). Here, we used 8 methods to fit an annual size-spectrum exponent, b, to an example data set (30 yr of the North Sea International Bottom Trawl Survey). The methods gave conflicting conclusions regarding b declining (the size spectrum steepening) through time, and so any resulting advice to ecosystem managers will be highly dependent upon the method used. Using simulated data, we showed that ignoring the bin structure gives biased estimates of b, even for high-resolution data. However, our extended likelihood method, which explicitly accounts for the bin structure, accurately estimated b and its confidence intervals, even for coarsely collected data. We developed a novel visualisation method that accounts for the bin structure and associated uncertainty, provide recommendations concerning different data types and have created an R package (sizeSpectra) to reproduce all results and encourage use of our methods. This work is also relevant to wider applications where a power-law distribution (the underlying distribution for a size spectrum) is fitted to binned data.},

  abstract = {Canopy-forming plants and algae commonly contribute to spatial variation in habitat complexity for associated organisms and thereby create a biotic patchiness of communities. In this study, we tested for interaction effects between biotic habitat com plexity and resource availability on net biomass production and species diversity of un derstory macroalgae by factorial field manipulations of light, nutrients, and algal canopy cover in a subtidal rocky-shore community. Presence of algal canopy cover and/or artificial shadings limited net biomass production and facilitated species diversity. Artificial shadings reduced light to levels similar to those under canopy cover, and net biomass production was significantly and positively correlated to light availability. Considering the comparable and dependent experimental effects from shadings and canopy cover, the results strongly suggest that canopy cover controlled net biomass production and species diversity by limiting light and thereby limiting resource availability for community production. Canopy cover also controlled experimental nutrient effects by preventing a significant increase in net biomass production from nutrient enrichment recorded in ambient light (no shading). Changes in species diversity were mediated by changes in species dominance patterns and species evenness, where canopy cover and shadings facilitated slow-growing crust-forming species and suppressed spatial dominance by Fucus vesiculosus, which was the main con tributor to net production of algal biomass. The demonstrated impacts of biotic habitat complexity on biomass production and local diversity contribute significantly to under standing the importance of functionally important species and biodiversity for ecosystem processes. In particular, this study demonstrates how loss of a dominant species and de creased habitat complexity change the response of the remaining assembly to resource loading. This is of potential significance for marine conservation since resource loading often promotes low habitat complexity and canopy species are among the first groups lost in degraded aquatic systems.

General reductions in the mean size of mussel and abalone shells gathered through time are attributed to growing human population and predation pressure. Based on comparison with historically documented changes in shellfish communities caused by the local extinction of sea otters in the 19th century, changes in mean shell size and the abundance of other shellfish species may have been facilitated by Native American predation on sea otters as early as 7500 years ago. Despite having measurable impacts on local ecosystems, Native Americans on San Miguel harvested huge quantities of shellfish throughout the Holocene. Such longterm harvests appear to have been sustained by an early emphasis on fishing at lower trophic levels, by periodically shifting village locations, and by intensifying the use of finfish and sea mammals through time. This pattern of ``fishing up the food web'' contrasts with many modern fisheries, suggesting that the study of ancient fisheries can help us better manage our own endangered coastal ecosystems.},

  abstract = {A variety of evidence suggests that the Americas may have been colonized, at least in part, by maritime peoples moving around the North Pacific Rim near the end of the Pleistocene. Understanding the geography of late glacial and early postglacial landscapes and the antiquity of human societies along the Pacific Coast continues to be a challenge, however, due to geological dynamics associated with glaciation, tectonism, submergence of coastal lowland landscapes by rising postglacial seas, and coastal erosion. Nonetheless, archaeological research has pushed back the antiquity of human settlement along the Pacific Coast of North America to the terminal Pleistocene or early Holocene, providing important new data on the nature of the earliest coastal peoples in the Pacific Northwest, Alta California, and Baja California. In this paper, we summarize what is known about the earliest peoples of the Pacific Coast of North America and evaluate the current viability of the coastal migration theory via a Pacific Rim route. Archaeological evidence now shows that Palaeocoastal peoples occupied each major region of the Pacific Coast by at least 13,000\textendash 11,500 calendar years ago (cal BP) (13\textendash 11.5 ka), essentially contemporaneous with Clovis and Folsom peoples of the interior. Although it is too early to conclude that the initial human colonization of the Americas took place via a migration by maritime or coastal peoples, it seems increasingly likely that such a migration played a role in the early peopling of the Americas.},

The p holds that where sea otters occur herbivores are rare and plants are abundant, where sea otters are absent herbivores are relatively common and plants are rare. Spatial p were based on 20 randomly placed quadrats at 153 randomly selected sites distrib among five locations with and four locations without sea otters. Both sea urchin an abundance differed significantly among locations with vs. without sea otters in the Islands and southeast Alaska. There was little (Aleutian Islands) or no (southeast A overlap between sites with and without sea otters, in plots of kelp density against biomass. Despite intersite variation in the abundance of kelps and herbivores, these a demonstrate that sea otter predation has a predictable and broadly generalizable in on the structure of Alaskan kelp forests. The percent cover of algal turf and sus feeder assemblages also differed significantly (although less dramatically) between l with and without sea otters. Temporal variation in community structure was assessed over periods of from 3 to 15 yr at sites in the Aleutian Islands and southeast Alaska where sea otters were 1) continuously present, 2) continuously absent, or 3) becoming reestablished because of natural range expansion. Kelp and sea urchin abundance remained largely unchanged at most sites where sea otters were continuously present or absent, the one exception being at Torch Bay (southeast Alaska), where kelp abundance varied significantly through time and urchin abundance varied significantly among sites because of episodic and patchy disturbances. In contrast, kelp and sea urchin abundances changed significantly, and in the expected directions, at sites that were being recolonized by sea otters. Sea urchin biomass declined by 50\% in the Aleutian Islands and by nearly 100\% in southeast Alaska following the spread of sea otters into previously unoccupied habitats. In response to these different rates and magnitudes of urchin reduction by sea otter predation, increases in kelp abundance were abrupt and highly significant in southeast Alaska but much smaller and slower over similar time periods in the Aleutian Islands.},

Here marine shorelines dating to the time of earliest post-glacial emergence are at least 197 m above present-day sealevel at 14,300 years ago. RSL fell rapidly, reaching two to three metres above present-day by 12,000 years ago. A series of raised marine terraces at ca. 4, 10 and 30 m above present day high tide level suggest the rapid fall in RSL during early post-glacial time may have been briefly interrupted by factors such as regional ice advances and recessions and global meltwater pulses generated by climatic variations. A possible minor sea-level transgression of 1e2 m around 12,000 to 11,400 years ago was followed by slow regression to modern levels. This sea-level reconstruction is providing critical input for efficient discovery and cataloging of late Pleistocene and early Holocene archaeological sites on ancient raised shorelines in the region. Integration of the sea-level history with LiDAR imagery has proven successful in locating a number of archaeological sites on these ancient shorelines.},

  abstract = {We analyzed 40 existing wetland rapid assessment methods that were developed for a variety of purposes, including informing regulatory decisions and local land use planning, and reviewed them for their potential to assess ecological integrity or condition. Four evaluation criteria were used. We determined if the method 1) can be used to measure condition, 2) is truly rapid, 3) includes a site visit, and 4) can be verified. This resulted in six methods being selected for evaluation relative to a conceptual model describing the core elements of a wetland assessment method, including universal indicators of soil, hydrology, and biotic communities, as well as regional indicators. An additional nine methods were kept for ideas on indicators, scoring, or regionalization. From this review, we identified five general areas that need to be addressed when adapting existing methods or developing new methods to assess condition: 1) definition of the assessment area, 2) treatment of wetland type, 3) approaches to scoring, 4) consideration of highly valued wetland types or features, and 5) procedures for validation with comprehensive ecological data. With scoring in particular, we present the advantages of a method that produces a single integrative score. Development of a rapid assessment method can assist those interested in incorporating condition assessment into their programs because they require less time in the field and less taxonomic expertise than more quantitative methods, which can lead to significant cost savings and increased sample sizes.},

  abstract = {Clove oil is used as a fish anesthetic because it is a natural and inexpensive product with low toxicity risks. The goal of the present study was to determine the appropriate concentration of clove oil for small-sized tropical fish to be used in mark-recapture studies or when individuals are to be sacrificed. We applied three different clove oil concentrations (D1=0.05 mL, D2=0.10 mL and D3=0.20 mL per 500 mL of water) on three small-sized fish species. We found a negative relationship between induction time and treatment for two species (Hyphessobrycon sp.1 and Hemigrammus sp.), while concentration was unrelated to recovery time. Fish body length was positively related to induction time in the D2 treatment for Hemigrammus sp., and negatively for Hyphessobrycon sp.1 in the D1 treatment, but was unrelated to recovery time for three species and treatments. Mortality rates varied across treatments, but higher rates were observed with higher clove oil concentrations. We conclude that 0.05 mL of clove oil per 500 mL of water is the most efficient dose for studies where fish will be released back to their natural habitats, while 0.20 mL of clove oil is recommended for studies that require fish euthanization for further laboratory analyses.},

In addition, we analysed the diet of the five most abundant species. Aggregations around all farms were large throughout the year, although species composition and abundance differed among farms and seasons. Fish farms are attractive habitats for certain species of wild fish in specific seasons. Adult fish of reproductive size dominated the assemblages, and stomach content analysis revealed that 66\textendash 89\% of fish of the five most abundant taxa had consumed food pellets lost from the cages. We estimated that wild fish consume up to 10\% of the pellets used at farms, indicating that food is a key attractant. Regional monitoring of farm-associated wild fish assemblages could aid management of the interaction of aquaculture and wild fish resources, because changes in feeding behaviour may have consequences for fish populations and local fisheries.},

We demonstrate how these three aspects may be seen as corresponding to three different victims of grade inflation\textemdash individuals, institutions, and society\textemdash and hence also to three potential agents of harm\textemdash teachers, schools, and educational systems. Next, we reflect upon various compelling reasons that these agents inflate grades, whether from an ethic of care, fiduciary responsibility, or simple self-preservation. Subsequently, we consider a variety of means of combatting grade inflation, and invite more educators and philosophers to delve into the complex practical ethics of grade inflation.},

Sedimentary records containing scales, bones or geochemical proxies of variability in fish populations provide unique insights on long-term ecosystem dynamics and relationships with climatic change. Available records from Holocene sediments are summarized and synthesized. The records are from several widespread locations near or along the continental margins of the South Atlantic and Pacific oceans, including Alaska, USA (Pacific salmon), Saanich and Effingham Inlets, British Columbia, Canada (pelagic fish), Santa Barbara Basin, California, USA (Northern anchovies and Pacific sardines), Gulf of California, Mexico (Pacific sardines, Northern anchovies and Pacific hake), Peru upwelling system (sardines, anchovies and hake), and Benguela Current System, South Africa (sardines, anchovies and hake). These records demonstrate that fish population sizes are not constant, and varied significantly over a range of time scales prior to the advent of large-scale commercial fishing. In addition to the decadal-scale variability commonly observed in historical records, the long-term records reveal substantial variability over centennial and millennial time scales. Shifts in abundance are often, but not always, correlated with regional and/or global climatic changes. The long-term perspective reveals different patterns of variability in fish populations, as well as fish\textendash climate relationships, than suggested by analysis of historical records. Many records suggest prominent changes in fish abundance at ca. 1000\textendash 1200 AD, during the Little Ice Age, and during the transition at the end of the Little Ice Age in the 19th century that may be correlative, and that were likely driven by major hemispheric or global reorganizations in the earth's climate system. Additional sedimentary records of marine fish abundance and corresponding paleoenvironmental conditions are likely to further enhance our understanding of marine ecosystem dynamics.},

Rock pools were more taxon rich than emergent substrata. Patterns varied with depth and incline with algal groups being more positively associated with shallow than deeper habitats. Substratum incline had little influence on colonising epibiota, with the exception of canopy algae in deeper habitats where vertical surfaces supported greater taxon richness than horizontal surfaces. The creation of artificial rock pools in built environments will have a positive effect on biodiversity. Building pools of varying depths and inclines and shore heights will provide a range of habitats, increase environmental heterogeneity, therefore creating more possible ecological niches, promoting local biodiversity.},

This approach requires an understanding of the types of assemblages and their functional roles that are desirable and feasible in these novel ecosystems. We review the major impacts coastal defence structures have on surrounding environments and recent experiments informing building coastal defences in a more ecologically sustainable manner. We summarise research carried out during the THESEUS project (2009\textendash 2014) which optimised the design of coastal defence structures with the aim to conserve or restore native species diversity. Native biodiversity could be manipulated on defence structures through various interventions: we created artificial rock pools, pits and crevices on breakwaters; we deployed a precast habitat enhancement unit in a coastal defence scheme; we tested the use of a mixture of stone sizes in gabion baskets; and we gardened native habitat-forming species, such as threatened canopy-forming algae on coastal defence structures. Finally, we outline guidelines and recommendations to provide multiple ecosystem services while maintaining engineering efficacy. This work demonstrated that simple enhancement methods can be costeffective measures to manage local biodiversity. Care is required, however, in the wholesale implementation of these recommendations without full consideration of the desired effects and overall management goals.},

The combination of time and complex human\textendash environment interactions in remote regions of North America has likely resulted in modified landscapes, though we often consider these regions free of human influence due to the absence of industrial development. We examined long-term impacts of human resource-use on British Columbia's coastal rainforest communities. We focused on the region's widespread habitation sites with extensive shell middens to test the legacy of ancient human occupation in present-day plant communities. Ten habitation sites and 10 control sites in similar locales were selected for floristic surveys and soil sampling. We tested whether plant communities at habitation sites reflected a `cultural plant-use legacy', with greater presence of culturally significant plant species, and/or a `marine nutrient subsidy legacy' from human use, with increases in species that prefer nutrient-rich soils. We found that the habitation sites had different plant assemblages than the control sites and were dominated by plants with both higher nutrient requirements and cultural significance. We demonstrate that long-term occupation has led to strong differences in plant community structure between sites, countering the notion that this is a pristine landscape. We emphasize the value of interdisciplinary approaches and considering past human resource-use when examining current plant communities. A plain language summary is available for this article.},

  abstract = {Human ecodynamics (H.E.) refers to processes of stability, resilience, and change in socio-ecological relationships or systems. H.E. research involves interdisciplinary study of the human condition as it affects and is affected by the rest of the non-human world. In this paper, we review the intellectual history of the human ecodynamics concept over the past several decades, as it has emerged out of classical ecology, anthropology, behavioral ecology, resilience theory, historical ecology, and related fields, especially with respect to the study of long-term socioecological change. Those who study human ecodynamics reject the notion that humans should be considered external to the environments in which they live and have lived for millennia. Many are interested in the resilience and sustainability of past human-natural configurations, often striving to extract lessons from the past that can benefit society today. H.E. research, involving the study of paleoenvironments and archaeology, has taken shape around a series of methodological advances that facilitate the study of past chronology, paleoecology, paleodemography, mobility, trade, and social networks. It is only through integrated study of 'coupled human-natural systems'\textemdash 'socio-ecosystems'\textemdash that we can hope to understand dynamic human-environmental interactions and begin to manage them for sustainable goals. Local and traditional or Indigenous knowledge provides another important influence to human ecodynamics research, and we explore how such knowledge can provide both expert witness into the operation of socioecological systems and insight into the human/cultural dimensions of those systems. Ultimately, we conclude that human ecodynamics is more encompassing than a number of related approaches and can provide a nexus for productive research. Through its interdisciplinary breadth, the framework unites scholarship that tends to be more isolated to address complex problems that are best tackled with diverse perspectives.},

  abstract = {Understanding and accurately modeling species distributions lies at the heart of many problems in ecology, evolution, and conservation. Multiple sources of data are increasingly available for modeling species distributions, such as data from citizen science programs, atlases, museums, and planned surveys. Yet reliably combining data sources can be challenging because data sources can vary considerably in their design, gradients covered, and potential sampling biases. We review, synthesize, and illustrate recent developments in combining multiple sources of data for species distribution modeling. We identify five ways in which multiple sources of data are typically combined for modeling species distributions. These approaches vary in their ability to accommodate sampling design, bias, and uncertainty when quantifying environmental relationships in species distribution models. Many of the challenges for combining data are solved through the prudent use of integrated species distribution models: models that simultaneously combine different data sources on species locations to quantify environmental relationships for explaining species distribution. We illustrate these approaches using planned survey data on 24 species of birds coupled with opportunistically collected eBird data in the southeastern United States. This example illustrates some of the benefits of data integration, such as increased precision in environmental relationships, greater predictive accuracy, and accounting for sample bias. Yet it also illustrates challenges of combining data sources with vastly different sampling methodologies and amounts of data. We provide one solution to this challenge through the use of weighted joint likelihoods. Weighted joint likelihoods provide a means to emphasize data sources based on different criteria (e.g., sample size), and we find that weighting improves predictions for all species considered. We conclude by providing practical guidance on combining multiple sources of data for modeling species distributions.},

  abstract = {The impact of an off-shore fish farm in Alghero Bay (northwest Sardinia, Italy) on the benthic ecosystem was investigated in 2007 and 2008. In addition to studying the chemical and physical characteristics of the area (i.e., currents and sediment analyses), some biological analyses were also performed. The AZTI's Marine Biotic Index (AMBI) and the multivariate AMBI (M-AMBI) were calculated, which are being used in assessing the ecological status of benthic communities within the European Water Framework Directive (WFD). Clear impact gradients were detected according to both methods; they are related to farm production, prevailing currents, and characteristics of the area (i.e., water depth and distance to the cages). The site affected most was detected within 84 m from the cages; the area that no longer showed effects was over 907 m from the cages. The gradient is shown by decreasing AMBI values and percentage of opportunistic species and increasing richness, diversity, and the presence of sensitive species. This study highlights the importance of setting reference conditions for different areas when calculating MAMBI. These reference conditions correspond to those in undisturbed sites in the opposite direction of the prevailing currents within the area.},

  abstract = {Oyster farming in estuaries is a globally important industry based primarily around the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, for which a common technique is elevated culture on racks, trestles and other structures. We review literature on cultivation impacts, revealing a research focus and state of knowledge that largely parallels that for other aquaculture species and cultivation methods. Ecological studies of elevated culture effects have focused on changes to the benthos from biodeposition, and largely show that impacts are localized and minor by comparison with many other forms of aquaculture. The broader ecological issues associated with elevated oyster culture include the effects of pests (fouling pests, toxic/noxious microalgae, disease), creation of novel habitat (e.g. by fouling of farm structures and accumulation of shell), alteration to nutrient cycling, depletion of suspended particulate matter by oyster crops, and related effects on higher trophic level animals including fish, seabirds and marine mammals. These issues are less well understood for elevated culture systems, but ecological effects can be inferred from the few studies that have been conducted, from other forms of bivalve aquaculture (e.g. mussels), and to some extent from fundamental knowledge of the role of oysters as `ecosystem engineers'. We use a risk ranking method to evaluate ecological risks (and associated uncertainty intervals) for each of the issues associated with estuarine oyster culture, based on subjective assessment of the likelihood and consequences (severity, spatial extent and duration) of adverse effects. Our assessment reveals that the introduction and spread of pest species are potentially important but often overlooked consequences of oyster cultivation. By comparison with most other sources of impact, the spread of pests by aquaculture activities can occur at regional scales, potentially leading to ecologically significant and irreversible changes to coastal ecosystems. We suggest that future studies of cultivation effects redress the balance of effort by focusing more on these significant issues and less on the effects of biodeposition in isolation. Furthermore, the acceptability of aquaculture operations or new developments should recognize the full range of effects, since adverse impacts may be compensated to some extent by the nominally `positive' effects of cultivation (e.g. habitat creation), or may be reduced by appropriate planning and management. Even more broadly, aquaculture developments should be considered in relation to other sources of environmental risk and cumulative impacts to estuarine systems at bay-wide or regional scales, so that the effects of cultivation are placed in context.},

We used carbon and nitrogen stable isotope data from 25 Pacific Northwest lakes to assess the relative importance of particulate organic matter (POM) from the mixed layer, below the mixed layer and terrestrial detritus to zooplankton. Zooplankton and deep POM were depleted in 13C relative to mixed layer POM in lakes that can support deep primary production. A Bayesian stable isotope mixing model estimated that terrestrial detritus contributed {$<$}5\% to zooplankton production, and confirms the role of lake optical and thermal properties; deep POM accounted for up to 80\% of zooplankton production in the clearest lakes. These results suggest terrestrial support of lake zooplankton production is trivial.},

Claims vary from persistent overuse to traditional practices of sustaining the resource base.

But, if the notion ``sustainable'' is to be consequential, the period under consideration must be meaningful \textendash{} claims that trends over a few years or even decades are representative of long-term phenomena are questionable, for they depend on numerous untested, if not untestable, assumptions. Research in anthropology, biology, biological conservation, ecology, policy, restoration ecology, social development, and wildlife management is routinely constrained to relatively short time periods, and such results are of limited value for evaluating sustainable use. Archaeozoology provides unique tools for investigating trends in human-resource relations over periods of centuries and millennia; it is one of the few disciplines explicitly dedicated to the study of material evidence over significant time periods that bears directly on the question of sustainable use. Hence, objective, scientific evaluation of sustainable use must contemplate archaeozoological evidence.},

Different studies often estimate complexity in different ways, and it is not always clear how precise the separate techniques are. Here we review three methods of estimating surface complexity: stereo photography, profile gauges, and lengths of chain contoured over the substratum. We derived fractal dimensions for the quadrats in the rocky intertidal zone using each technique. Complexity estimates from chains and profile gauges were related, but neither technique was correlated with the results from stereo photographs. Stereo photographs appeared to overestimate complexity on smooth surfaces. The variance of fractal dimension estimates increased nonlinearly with the mean fractal dimension in each quadrat. Recommendations for the number of replicates needed for a reliable estimate of fractal dimension from a quadrat, therefore, vary as a function of surface complexity. Within the range of complexities typically encountered on rocky shores, as few as three profiles or sets of chains can produce relatively reliable estimates of fractal dimension. The most robust and time effective method, however, would be to sample using as many chain profile sets per quadrat as is logistically feasible. Given the changes in precision with surface complexity, comparisons between studies need to take careful note of the number of replicates and the average level of surface complexity. A null result (no relationship between surface complexity and an ecological variable) could be produced by imprecise estimates of surface complexity based on too few replicate measurements per quadrat.},

A percent live coral cover is the variable that has highest correlation with coral reef rugosity and then followed by genera richness, Shannon diversity index, and evenness.

Tombariri has higher coefficient of determination of linear regression (r2=0.526) than Bunakan Island (r2=0.296). None of second order polynomial regression was significant. Therefore linear regression model can better explain the variation of percent live coral cover, genera richness, Shannon diversity index, and evenness rather than a second order polynomial regression model, at least in the Bunaken National Park.

For years, researchers have studied ways to improve such student assignments by making them more interesting, applicable, and valuable to the student with a goal of improving learning outcomes by increasing student appeal. One often studied way to improve the learning outcome is by allowing students a choice in assignments. To ensure fairness for all students in providing such a choice, care must be taken to ensure assignment ``equality'' by ensuring an equal learning experience for all students regardless of their choice of homework assignments. Our introductory computer science class is a survey class which covers multiple topics including programming concepts, word processing, presentation software, computer security, spreadsheet usage and databases design and implementation. Students perform several programming exercises throughout the course to demonstrate their knowledge and improve their skill in programming. For a number of years, we've offered students a choice on their final assignment. Worth 10\% of the course grade, the assignment provides students with either an analytical programming project or a software applications based project. The purpose of this paper is to look at the motivations that drove students to make the choice they did and the impact of their choice on their assignment grade and overall performance on the course final. Our findings indicate that care must be taken when offering options to the student as the choice the student makes may unintentionally and adversely affect both their learning experience and course performance.},

PBRs document folk ecological knowledge and practices involving the use of natural resources, with the help of local educational institutions and NGOs working in collaboration with local, decentralized institutions of governance. During 1996-1998, 52 such documents were prepared from village clusters distributed in eight states and union territories representing a wide spectrum of ecological and social regimes of India. They reveal a picture of generally declining productivity and diversity of living resources outside of intensively managed ecosystems. There are, however, notable exceptions; two of our case studies provide examples of self-organized systems of management that have successfully protected, and indeed promoted, restoration of forest and wildlife resources. The PBRs also indicate a widespread erosion of practical ecological knowledge and of traditions of sustainable use and conservation. This is linked to the fact that those most intimately dependent on and knowledgeable about biodiversity belong to the economically and politically most disadvantaged segments of the society. In consequence, conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity are not a high priority among the development aspirations held by the people. Nevertheless, people are concerned about degradation of the base of living resources and offer a number of concrete suggestions on their management. In fact, in a few cases, the PBR exercises have encouraged people to put such measures for more prudent use of local biodiversity resources into practice. The process of preparation of PBRs, as well as the resultant documents, could serve a significant role in promoting more sustainable, flexible, participatory systems of management and in ensuring a better flow of benefits from economic use of the living resources to the local communities.},

  abstract = {Coral reefs exhibit consistent patterns in biodiversity across multiple spatial scales, from local to global clines in species richness, abundance and community structure. Knowledge of fundamental processes driving these patterns is largely derived from studies of shallow, emergent and nearshore reefs. Although research efforts are expanding to deeper mesophotic coral reef ecology, distinct and isolated reef morphologies like submerged pinnacles or seamounts have received scant attention. Despite being potentially important for connectivity and as refugia, the extent to which established patterns and processes in coral reef ecology apply to these systems is unknown. Here we examine the fish and benthic communities associated with coral reefs found on submerged pinnacles in Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea. Community structure and diversity metrics are compared with emergent reefs at the same depth in both near and offshore settings. We then explicitly test whether benthic complexity variables known to influence reef fish communities exhibit similar patterns at each reef type. Pinnacles were characterised by 3.70 times the mean fish abundance and 1.98 times the species richness recorded at the same depths on emergent reefs. Fish community structure showed distinct separation across reef morphologies, with pinnacles most similar to offshore reefs. Benthic habitat complexity did not vary across reef types while fish assemblages were weakly related to benthic habitat variables, with reef morphology the most consistent predictor of fish community metrics. The pinnacles in our study support high coral reef fish biodiversity despite their small habitat area and relative isolation by depth and offshore setting. Our results suggest that habitat-specific environmental conditions are generated by the distinct geomorphology of pinnacles. As coastal reefs become more increasingly disturbed, understanding ecological patterns on deep patch reef habitats like pinnacles will be useful to provide a more holistic understanding of coral reef seascapes and their resilience.gal},

  abstract = {We examined biotic and abiotic variables on the expansive intertidal mudflats of the upper Bay of Fundy, Canada, at 8 geographically separate sites over 2 years (2009\textendash 2011). Invertebrate density, surface density of primary producers (mainly diatoms, measured as chlorophyll-a concentration), shorebird- and fish-foraging activity, and sediment properties varied considerably through time and space. Dissimilarity in the invertebrate community between consecutive sampling rounds was lower during peaks in density and richness (June\textendash August) than during periods of low density and richness (December\textendash March). All but one site located within Chignecto Bay (one arm of the upper Bay of Fundy) had similar invertebrate communities; sites within the Minas Basin (the other arm of the upper Bay) had more distinct communities compared to Chignecto Bay mudflats. The amphipod Corophium volutator, Copepoda, Ostracoda, and the polychaetes Phyllodocidae and Spionidae were usually main contributors to observed community differences over space and time. Although our sites are all silt-dominated mudflats, mean particle size, sediment penetrability, and depth to the apparent redox discontinuity potential (aRDP, a measure of sediment-oxygen content) were usually main contributors to site differences in sediment conditions. However, when we pooled samples over sites and sampling rounds, percent water content and percent organic-matter content accounted for the majority of the variation in sediment properties, likely reflecting within-site patchiness. Such quantification of spatiotemporal patterns in biotic and abiotic variables is an essential first step in the development of predictive models or the design of manipulative experiments to investigate ecological relationships.},

  abstract = {The only possible way to increase seafood yields from many coastal and continental shelf regions of the world is through aquaculture. The most ecologically efficient forms of aquaculture are those operations culturing plants and lower trophic level animals, such as bivalve molluscs. It is therefore understandable why culturing of these organisms has steadily increased over at least the last two decades. However, the expansion of large-scale aquaculture has costs in terms of loss of water space that could be used for other activities, and carbon flows directed through the bivalves that could have been used to support other marine plants and animals (predation and production foregone). The dominant present users of many, if not most, coastal and continental shelf regions are commercial and, in some cases, recreational and indigenous customary fishers. Therefore, in many cases, it is these stakeholders who will stand to pay much of the direct costs of the expansion of aquaculture. Therefore, it is inevitable that in some cases, there will be conflict between these sectors as water space becomes more in demand and, hence, more valuable. Resource managers are therefore faced with making resource allocation decisions between alternate sectors, and these decisions should be based on robust knowledge of the costs and benefits of each alternative use. In the case of allocation decisions between bivalve aquaculture and wild stock fisheries, there is presently a paucity of knowledge surrounding the interactions between these two activities. The aim of the work presented here was to develop a framework for understanding these interactions and applying the framework in a case study in New Zealand.},

Moreover, the model suggest that in oligotrophic lakes, microbial respiration may greatly exceed the current estimates based on bacterial production data and that heterotrophs contribute proportionately more to total plankton metabolism than they do in eutrophic lakes. Because such high respiration rates require external energy subsidies, these results; challenge the view that pelagial communities of most lakes are even approximately self-supporting.},

Therefore, to inform future management decisions, we conducted a meta-analysis of studies comparing the ecosystem services of biodiversity (richness or diversity) and habitat provisioning (organism abundance) along shorelines with versus without engineered-shore structures. Seawalls supported 23\% lower biodiversity and 45\% fewer organisms than natural shorelines. In contrast, biodiversity and abundance supported by riprap or breakwater shorelines were not different from natural shorelines; however, effect sizes were highly heterogeneous across organism groups and studies. As coastal development increases, the type and location of shoreline hardening could greatly affect the habitat value and functioning of nearshore ecosystems.},

One principal theoretical framework exists for such patterns, the ``habitat-heterogeneity hypothesis (HHH)'', which postulates a positive relationship between species diversity and habitat heterogeneity. Although HHH is widely accepted, spatial and temporal variability has been found in the relationship between diversity and heterogeneity. Species turnover has been proposed as the main factor explaining spatial variation in the relationship between species diversity and habitat heterogeneity. In this study, we tested the role of species turnover in explaining spatial and temporal variability on diversityeheterogeneity relationship in a Mediterranean ecosystem, using beetles as the study organisms. A hierarchical design including different habitats and years was used to test our hypothesis. Using different multivariate analyses, we tested for spatial and temporal variability in beta diversity, and in the beetle diversityeheterogeneity relationship using two diversity indices. Our study showed that beetle composition changed spatially and temporally, although temporal change was evident only between sampling periods but not between years. Notably, there was spatial and temporal change in the relationship between habitat descriptors and beetle diversity. Nevertheless, there was no correlation between the changes in beetle composition with the changes in the habitat-heterogeneity relationships. In this Mediterranean system, spatial and temporal changes in the diversityeheterogeneity relationships cannot be predicted by species turnover, and other mechanisms need to be explored to satisfactorily explain this variability.},

On coral reefs, structural complexity is typically measured using a single and small-scale metric (`rugosity') that represents multiple spatial attributes differentially exploited by species, thus limiting a complete understanding of how fish associate with reef structure. We used a novel approach to compare relationships between fishes and previously unavailable components of reef complexity, and contrasted the results against the traditional rugosity index. This study focused on damselfish to explore relationships between fishes and reef structure. Three territorial species, with contrasting trophic habits and expected use of the reef structure, were examined to infer the potential species-specific mechanisms associated with how complexity influences habitat selection. Three-dimensional reef reconstructions from photogrammetry quantified the following metrics of habitat quality: 1) visual exposure to predators and competitors, 2) density of predation refuges and 3) substrate-related food availability. These metrics explained the species distribution better than the traditional measure of rugosity, and each species responded to different complexity components. Given that a critical effect of reef degradation is loss of structure, adopting three-dimensional technologies potentially offers a new tool to both understand species-habitat association and help forecast how fishes will be affected by the flattening of reefs.},

  abstract = {Global species extinction rates are orders of magnitude above the background rate documented in the fossil record. However, recent data syntheses have found mixed evidence for patterns of net species loss at local spatial scales. For example, two recent data meta-a\-nalyses have found that species richness is decreasing in some locations and is increasing in others. When these trends are combined, these papers argued there has been no net change in species richness, and suggested this pattern is globally representative of biodiversity change at local scales. Here we reanalyze results of these data syntheses and outline why this conclusion is unfounded.

However, recent data syntheses have found mixed evidence for patterns of net species loss at local spatial scales. For example, two recent data meta-a\-nalyses have found that species richness is decreasing in some locations and is increasing in others. When these trends are combined, these papers argued there has been no net change in species richness, and suggested this pattern is globally representative of biodiversity change at local scales.

In spite of its importance, ecologists have not always appreciated the effects of abundance and sampling effort on richness measures and comparisons. We survey a series of common pitfalls in quantifying and comparing taxon richness. These pitfalls can be largely avoided by using accumulation and rarefaction curves, which may be based on either individuals or samples. These taxon sampling curves contain the basic information for valid richness comparisons, including category{$\pm$}subcategory ratios (species-to-genus and species-toindividual ratios). Rarefaction methods {$\pm$} both sample-based and individual-based {$\pm$} allow for meaningful standardization and comparison of datasets. Standardizing data sets by area or sampling effort may produce very different results compared to standardizing by number of individuals collected, and it is not always clear which measure of diversity is more appropriate. Asymptotic richness estimators provide lower-bound estimates for taxon-rich groups such as tropical arthropods, in which observed richness rarely reaches an asymptote, despite intensive sampling. Recent examples of diversity studies of tropical trees, stream invertebrates, and herbaceous plants emphasize the importance of carefully quantifying species richness using taxon sampling curves.},

  abstract = {Fishes not only play an important role in the demand of food for humans but they have also emerged as major model organisms for different biomedical researches. A number of experiments with the use of several drugs have been conducted in fish. Diseases in fish caused by bacteria are most widespread. Antibiotics are frequently used to control fish diseases caused by bacteria, but there is an increasing risk of developing antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria. The medicinal plants can act as immunostimulants, conferring early activation to the non-specific defense mechanisms of fish and elevating the specific immune response. The herbs contain many immunologically active components such as polysaccharides, organic acids, alkaloids, glycosides and volatile oils, which can enhance immune functions. Recently, there has been increased interest in the immune stimulating function of some herbs in aquaculture. The nonspecific immune functions such as bacteriolytic activity and leukocyte function of fish have been improved by some herbs. Henceforth, this article elucidates certain herbs (medicinal plants) which have been shown experimentally as well as clinically to possess immunostimulant effects in fish, thereby treating different fish diseases.},

  abstract = {Although multiple predator effects and trophic cascades have both been demonstrated in a wide variety of ecosystems, ecologists have yet to incorporate these studies into an experimental framework that also manipulates a common and likely important factor, spatial heterogeneity. We manipulated habitat complexity, the presence of two top predators (toadfish and blue crabs), and one intermediate predator (mud crabs) to determine whether habitat complexity influences the strength of multiple predator interactions across multiple trophic levels in experimental oyster reef communities. In the absence of toadfish, blue crabs caused significant mud crab mortality. Despite also directly consuming mud crabs, toadfish indirectly benefited this intermediate predator by decreasing blue crab consumption of mud crabs. Toadfish suppression of mud crab foraging activity, and thus decreased mud crab encounters with blue crabs, is likely responsible for this counterintuitive result. Contrary to previous investigations which suggest that more complex habitats reduce interference interactions among predators, reef complexity strengthened emergent multiple predator effects (MPEs) on mud crabs. The degree to which these MPEs cascaded down to benefit juvenile oysters (basal prey) depended on both habitat complexity and nonconsumptive effects derived from predator-predator interactions. Habitat complexity reduced the foraging efficiency of each crab species individually but released crab interference interactions when together, so that the two crabs collectively consumed more oysters on complex reefs. Regardless of reef complexity, toadfish consistently decreased consumption of oysters by both crab species individually and when together. Therefore, interactions between predator identity and habitat complexity structure trophic cascades on oyster reefs. Furthermore, these cascading effects of multiple predators were largely mediated by nonconsumptive effects in this system. Key words: blue crabs; consumptive effects; density-mediated indirect interactions (DMIIs); habitat complexity; mud crabs; multiple-predator interactions; nonconsumptive effects; oysters; predator avoidance behavior; toadfish; trait-mediated indirect interactions (LMIIs); trophic cascades.},

  abstract = {The data requirements and resources needed to develop multispecies indicators of fishing impacts are often lacking and this is particularly true for coral reef fisheries. Size-spectra, relationships between abundance and body-size class, regardless of taxonomy, can be calculated from simple sizeabundance data. Both the slope and the mid-point height of the relationship can be compared at different fishing intensities. Here, we develop size-spectra for reef fish assemblages using body size- abundance data collected by underwater visual census in each of ten fishing grounds across a known gradient of fishing intensity in the Kadavu Island group, Fiji. Slopes of the size-spectra became steeper (F9,69=3.20, p{$<$}0.01) and the height declined (F9,69=15.78, p{$<$}0.001) with increasing fishing intensity. Regressions of numbers of individuals per size class across grounds were negative for all size classes, although the slope was almost zero for the smallest size class. Response to exploitation of each size class category was greatest for larger fish. Steepening of the slope with increasing fishing intensity largely resulted from reductions in the relative abundance of large fish and not from the ecological release of small fish following depletion of their predators. The slope and height of the size-spectrum appear to be good indicators of fishing effects on reef fish assemblages.},

In a 1,500-2,500-m depth range off New Jersey and Delaware, 233 30 x 30-cm samples contained 798 species in 171 families and 14 phyla. Addition of stations from sites to the north and south approximately doubled the number of samples and doubled the number of species to 1,597. Species-area curves do not level off within stations or when stations are added together. Moreover, the proportion of species represented by single individuals is high at all scales of sampling, which indicates that much more sampling is needed to adequately represent the species richness either locally or regionally. Diversity changes very little through time at a single site or with distance along a 180-km transect at a depth of 2,100 m. Diversity is maintained by a combination of biogenic microhabitat heterogeneity in a system with few barriers to dispersal, disturbance created by feeding activities of larger animals, and food resources divided into patches of a few square meters to square centimeters initiated by specific temporally separated events.},

  abstract = {Sets of artificial reefs were replicated in 5 bays off Tortola in the British Virgin Islands to investigate the effects of habitat complexity on fish assemblages. Increasing percentage hard substrate and the number of small reef holes increased fish abundance on reefs. The observed number of species (Sobs) occurring on each reef increased with increasing rugosity, variety of growth forms, percentage hard substrate, and variety of refuge hole sizes. A rarefied or abundance-corrected species richness measure (Srare) was calculated to take the varying fish abundances into account. After this correction, rugosity was the only variable that significantly increased fish species-richness. Experimental reefs of different height (20 and 60 cm) did not have significantly different fish abundance or species richness. The presence of long-spined sea urchins Diadema antillarum increased Sobs and total fish abundance on artificial rock-reefs and in seagrass beds, but the effect was most pronounced in seagrass beds where shelter was a strongly limiting factor. These results indicate that complex habitats or animals such as D. antillarum that provide shelter to fish are essential for maintaining fish biodiversity at local scales. The most important aspects of complexity are rugosity, hard substrate and small refuge holes. Artificial reefs may be used to mitigate habitat damage in impacted areas, and if management objectives are to increase local fish abundance and species richness, the reefs should provide a stable substrate where this is unavailable, have a rugose surface with many small refuge holes, and have a variety of growth forms.},

Ten percent or 110 miles of California's entire coastline has now been armored, although coastal protection structures can vary widely in their cost, size, effectiveness, lifespan and impacts. The increase in the amount of coastline armored in recent decades as well as proposals for new projects has been accompanied by an increased concern with the cumulative impacts of these protection structures. The potential impacts of armoring the coastline include visual effects, impoundment or placement losses, reduction of beach access, loss of sand supply, and passive and active erosion.

  abstract = {Maintaining food production while sustaining productive ecosystems is among the central challenges of our time, yet, it has been for millennia. Ancient clam gardens, intertidal rock-walled terraces constructed by humans during the late Holocene, are thought to have improved the growing conditions for clams. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the beach slope, intertidal height, and biomass and density of bivalves at replicate clam garden and non-walled clam beaches in British Columbia, Canada. We also quantified the variation in growth and survival rates of littleneck clams (Leukoma staminea) we experimentally transplanted across these two beach types. We found that clam gardens had significantly shallower slopes than non-walled beaches and greater densities of L. staminea and Saxidomus giganteus, particularly at smaller size classes. Overall, clam gardens contained 4 times as many butter clams and over twice as many littleneck clams relative to nonwalled beaches. As predicted, this relationship varied as a function of intertidal height, whereby clam density and biomass tended to be greater in clam gardens compared to non-walled beaches at relatively higher intertidal heights. Transplanted juvenile L. staminea grew 1.7 times faster and smaller size classes were more likely to survive in clam gardens than nonwalled beaches, specifically at the top and bottom of beaches. Consequently, we provide strong evidence that ancient clam gardens likely increased clam productivity by altering the slope of soft-sediment beaches, expanding optimal intertidal clam habitat, thereby enhancing growing conditions for clams. These results reveal how ancient shellfish aquaculture practices may have supported food security strategies in the past and provide insight into tools for the conservation, management, and governance of intertidal seascapes today.},

Although not meant to be an exhaustive review, we identify several important issues with tentative solutions where they exist (e.g. dealing with collinearity amongst predictors; how to compute model-averaged parameters) and highlight areas for future research where solutions are not clear (e.g. when to use random intercepts or slopes; which information criteria to use when random factors are involved). We also provide a worked example of a mixed model analysis of inbreeding depression in a wild population. By providing an overview of these issues, we hope that this approach will become more accessible to those investigating any process where multiple variables impact an evolutionary or ecological response.},

We investigated spatial and temporal variations in primary productivity, total and size-fractionated phytoplankton chl a, dissolved nutrients, temperature and salinity at the head and mouth of Saanich Inlet from May 2005 to November 2006. New primary productivity was also measured from May to October 2006. During the growing season (spring, summer and fall), primary productivity was 1.5 times higher at the mouth than at the head of Saanich Inlet and, averaged across stations, total productivity was 460 g C m\`A2 y\`A1. Average new productivity was 53\% and 58\% of total primary productivity at the head and mouth of the inlet, respectively, and during the growing season micro-phytoplankton (4 20 mm; mainly diatoms) was the most abundant size-class of phytoplankton. These rates of primary production are as high as or higher than those measured in other fjords, possibly because of a tidally-driven fortnightly gravity exchange that supplies nutrients to surface waters that enhance biological production when nutrients would otherwise be limiting. This exchange delivers nutrients at least as far inland as the head station, while nutrients associated with an eddy near the mouth may be the cause of even higher productivity there. We discuss the impact of these nutrient sources to Saanich Inlet on the records of paleoproduction generated from two Ocean Drilling Program cores extracted from this fjord, and suggest that the fortnightly exchange buffers variations in nutrient supply occurring on sub-decadal or decadal scales. \& 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Failure to detect a species' presence in an occupied habitat patch is a common sampling problem when the population size is small, individuals are difficult to sample, or sampling effort is limited. In this paper, the influence of non-detection of occurrence on parameter estimates of logistic regression models of wildlife\textendash habitat relationships was assessed using analytical analysis and simulations. Two patterns of non-detection were investigated: (1) a random distribution of non-detection among occupied patches; and (2) a non-random distribution of nondetection in which the probability of detecting a species in an occupied patch covaried with measurable habitat variables. Our results showed that logistic regression models of wildlife\textendash habitat relationships were sensitive to even low levels of non-detection in occupancy data. Both analytic and simulation studies show that non-detection yields bias in parameter estimation of logistic regression models. More importantly, the direction of bias was affected by the underlying pattern of non-detection and whether the habitat variable was positively or negatively related to occupancy. For a positive habitat coefficient, a random distribution of nondetection yielded negative bias in estimation, whereas linkage of the probability of non-detection to habitat covariates produced positive bias. For a negative habitat coefficient, the pattern was reversed, with a random distribution of non-detection leading to positive bias in estimation. A release\textendash recapture livetrapping study of small mammals in central Indiana, USA, was used to illustrate the magnitude of non-detection in a typical field sampling protocol with varying levels of sampling intensity. Estimates of nondetection error ranged from 0 to 23\% for seven species after 5 days of sampling. We suggest that for many sampling situations, relationships between probability of detection and habitat covariates need to be established to correctly interpret results of wildlife\textendash habitat models.},

  abstract = {Distribution patterns of epibenthic assemblages, sea urchins and fishes were assessed in NE Sardinia (Mediterranean Sea) in shallow (4 to 7 m depth) rocky habitats with 2 rock-type substrates, i.e. limestone and granite, to examine possible differences related to the mineralogical composition of rocks. Sessile organisms and sea urchins were sampled in situ within quadrats. Fishes were assessed by visual census transects. Sessile epibenthic assemblages significantly differed between granite and limestone substrates, and the number of epibenthic sessile taxa was greater on limestone. Average cover of the algae mat (unidentified mixture of filamentous and mucilaginous algae) was significantly greater on granite than limestone, while no significant differences were detected in total cover or in the average cover of the remaining most common epibenthic taxa. Densities of sea urchins (i.e. Paracentrotus lividus and Arbacia lixula) did not differ between the 2 rock types. Fish assemblages were significantly different between granite and limestone rock substrates. Labrids of the genus Symphodus and Serranus scriba were more abundant on granite, whereas Serranus cabrilla, Parablennius rouxi, Gobius bucchichi and Thalassoma pavo showed greater densities on limestone. Sarpa salpa (the most important herbivorous fish in the Mediterranean sublittoral) did not show any significant difference between granite and limestone substrates. These results suggest that rock type may have the potential to influence marine assemblages, probably through direct effects on epibenthic organisms (e.g. the presence of quartz and substrate texture, both related to the mineralogical features of rocks), and indirect effects on fishes (e.g. the influence of the structure of the epibenthic cover). These results suggest a possible role of the mineralogical composition of rocks in `bottom-up' processes influencing marine assemblages in shallow sublittoral rocky habitats in the Mediterranean, where direct effects on sessile organisms (e.g. macroalgae) may cascade up through the entire community and affect higher trophic levels (e.g. carnivorous fishes). However, extensive experimental work is needed before drawing any conclusion about the specific processes determining the patterns we observed.},

There has been much work ongoing by Universities, in partnership with First Nations to better understand these ancient aquaculture practices. The Hul'q'umi'num-Gulf Islands National Park Reserve Committee (H-GINPR Committee, or the Committee) has been encouraging Parks Canada to rehabilitate beaches for close to ten years. Recently Parks Canada initiated a 5 year project to restore and further understand these ancient aquaculture practices in the Gulf Islands National Park Reserve (GINPR). Important in the project was creating a document that ensured recognition of intellectual property of the people who shared it. The Committee struck the Stutul'na'mut Working Group of Sul-hwe'en (Elders), Hul'q'umi'num speakers and harvesters to compile their knowledge. The body of knowledge, orally and practically transmitted, through family lines and generations, included details of construction methodologies, maintenance and use, and the cultural, spiritual, medicinal, and nutritional value of the resources. Of primary importance to the body of information gathered was the Hul'q'umi'num language of the aquaculture practices. The Hul'q'umi'num system of naming does not provide for a single name for the practice, as there is no single word for `beach' either. The naming practice identified specific beaches individually, not as a generic term. Many factors, including residential schools, the contemporary school system itself, leases and tenuring of the foreshore, and high levels of development in the Southern Gulf Islands and south east coast of Vancouver Island has interfered with the Hul'q'umi'num care of their beaches. The H-GINPR Committee considered the understanding, care and maintenance of the beaches to be particular significance and valued this knowledge as being integral to continuing the traditions and the passing of the knowledge to the next generation. As well as, contributing to the greater body of knowledge of traditional ecological responsibilities, obligations and respect as carried out by of the Hul'q'umi'num Nations in their territory.},

Small sample space examples are used to illustrate unbiasedness of mean-per-unit estimators of the mean, total and proportion of the target variable, y, for SWR and SRS. Explicit formulas for sampling variance indicate how estimator uncertainty depends on finite population variance, sample size and sampling fraction. Measures of the relative performance of alternative sampling strategies (relative precision, relative efficiency, net relative efficiency) are introduced and applied to mean-per-unit estimators used for the SWR and SRS selection methods. Normality of the sampling distribution of the SRS mean-per-unit estimator depends on sample size but also on the shape of the distribution of the target variable, y, values over the finite population units. Normality of the sampling distribution is required to justify construction of valid 95\% confidence intervals that may be constructed around sample estimates based on unbiased estimates of sampling variance. Methods to calculate sample size to achieve accuracy objectives are presented. Additional topics include Bernoulli sampling (a without replacement selection scheme for which sample size is a random variable), the Rao\textendash Blackwell theorem (which allows improvement of estimators that are based on selection methods which may result in repeated selection of the same units), oversampling and nonresponse.},

Sampling theory concerns itself with development of procedures for random selection of a subset of units, a sample, from a larger finite population, and with how to best use sample data to make scientifically and statistically sound inferences about the population as a whole. The inferences fall into two broad categories: (a) estimation of simple descriptive population parameters, such as means, totals, or proportions, for variables of interest, and (b) estimation of uncertainty associated with estimated parameter values. Although the targets of estimation are few and simple, estimates of means, totals, or proportions see important and often controversial uses in management of natural resources and in fundamental ecological research, but few ecologists or natural resource scientists have formal training in sampling theory. We emphasize the classical design-based approach to sampling in which variable values associated with units are regarded as fixed and uncertainty of estimation arises via various randomization strategies that may be used to select samples. In addition to covering standard topics such as simple random, systematic, cluster, unequal probability (stressing the generality of Horvitz\textendash Thompson estimation), multi-stage, and multi-phase sampling, we also consider adaptive sampling, spatially balanced sampling, and sampling through time, three areas of special importance for ecologists and natural resource scientists. The text is directed to undergraduate seniors, graduate students, and practicing professionals. Problems emphasize application of the theory and R programming in ecological and natural resource settings.},

The simple two-occasion context frames the trade-offs in design of surveys to achieve these objectives. If the objective is to estimate change in status (trend), then most precise estimation is achieved by full retention of a random sample selected at time 1. If the objective is to estimate average status, then most precise estimation is achieved by selecting independent random samples. If a survey has both objectives, then a compromise design, involving partial retention and partial replacement of the initial sample, is optimal (i.e., will have intermediate performance for status and trend). Sampling designs for long-term monitoring (and before/after assessment monitoring) have two distinct components: a membership design which specifies selection of groups of units to be designated as sample panels, and a revisit design that specifies when these panels of units should be visited (revisited). For example, some randomly selected panels might be visited in years one to three, then dropped out of rotation for three years and then revisited in years\textendash seven to nine, and so on. One panel might be revisited every year, and other panels might be visited only a single time. Design-based estimates of measures of status and trend are derived for some simple membership and revisit designs.

A sample of n clusters is selected by SRS, y values of all population units within clusters are measured, and an unbiased estimator of the population mean is the simple average of cluster means in the sample. An ANOVA sum of squares partition can be used to show that this strategy will outperform SRS with mean-per-unit estimation whenever the mean square between clusters is less than the finite population variance. This means that it is desirable for clusters to have similar means but a great deal of variability within clusters, a contrast with the desirable characteristics of strata (little variability within strata, substantial difference between stratum means). Many methods of collection of samples in fisheries (seines, nets) and wildlife (mist nets, live traps) involve collection of individuals as clusters. Unfortunately, clusters (e.g., human families) often consist of closely related or similar individuals. Because within cluster variation is often relatively low, it is often advantageous and cost-effective to instead adopt two-stage cluster sampling (considered in Chapter 9) for which only a sample of units within each selected cluster are examined, thereby allowing more clusters to be examined for the same total survey cost.},

  abstract = {Abstract             In many ecological and natural resource settings, there may be a high degree of spatial structure or pattern to the distribution of target variable values across the landscape. For example, the number of trees per hectare killed by a bark beetle infestation may be exceptionally high in one region of a national forest and near zero elsewhere. In such circumstances it may be highly desirable or even required that a sample survey directed at estimation of total tree mortality across a forest be based on selection of random locations that have good spatial balance, i.e., locations are well spread over the landscape with relatively even distances between them. A simple random sample cannot guarantee good spatial balance. We present two methods that have been proposed for selection of spatially balanced samples: GRTS (Generalized Random Tessellation Stratified Sampling) and BAS (Balanced Acceptance Sampling). Selection of samples using the GRTS approach involves a complicated series of sequential steps that allows generation of spatially balanced samples selected from finite populations or from infinite study areas. Selection of samples using BAS relies on the Halton sequence, is conceptually simpler, and produces samples that generally have better spatial balance than those produced by GRTS. Both approaches rely on use of software that is available in the R statistical/programming environment. Estimation relies on the Horvitz\textendash Thompson estimator. Illustrative examples of running the SPSURVEY software package (used for GRTS) and links to the SDraw package (used for BAS) are provided at http://global.oup.com/uk/companion/hankin.},

  abstract = {Aquaculture is one of the fastest growing food-producing sectors around the world. Among various kinds of cultivated organisms many marine and freshwater finfish and shellfish species constitute an important industry with their production increasing every year. Recently due to intensive farming practices infectious diseases pose a major problem in aquaculture industry, causing heavy loss to farmers. A number of approaches have been made to control diseases including sanitary prophylaxis, disinfection, and chemotherapy with particular emphasis on the use of antibiotics. However, the application of antibiotics and chemicals in culture is often expensive and undesirable since it leads to antibiotic and chemical resistance and consumer reluctance. Therefore immunostimulants such as glucan, chitin, lactoferrin, levamisole, and some medicinal plant extracts or products have been used to control fish and shellfish diseases. In this regard the medicinal plant extracts and their products act as immunostimulants modulating the immune response to prevent and control fish and shellfish diseases. The immunostimulants mainly facilitate the function of phagocytic cells, increase their bactericidal activities, and stimulate the natural killer cells, complement, lysozyme activity, and antibody responses in fish and shellfish which confer enhanced protection from infectious diseases. Currently increased consumer demand for perfection in fish and shellfish farms has put new dimensions to the quality, safety, elimination of concomitant pollutants, antibiotics, and carcinogens during the production process. In this context plants or their byproducts are preferred since they contain several phenolic, polyphenolic, alkaloid, quinone, terpenoid, lectine, and polypeptide compounds many of which have been shown to be very effective alternatives to antibiotics, chemicals, vaccines, and other synthetic compounds. In aquaculture the herbal medicines are also known to exhibit anti-microbial activity, facilitate growth, and maturation of cultured species; besides under intensive farming the anti-stress characteristics of herbs will be of immense use without posing any environmental hazard. Administration of herbal extracts or their products at various concentrations through oral (diet) or injection route enhance the innate and adaptive immune response of different freshwater and marine fish and shellfish against bacterial, viral, and parasitic diseases. Even an overdose of immunostimulants may induce immunosuppression without side effects but helps to reduce the losses caused by disease in aquaculture. The present review describes the role of medicinal herbs and their products on innate and adaptive immune response of finfish and shellfish. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The vertical extent of mussel beds decreased by 51\% in 52 years, and reproductive populations of mussels disappeared at several sites. Prey species were able to occupy a hot, extralimital site if predation pressure was experimentally reduced, and local species richness more than doubled as a result.

  abstract = {The use of unmanned aircraft systems (UASs), commonly referred to as drones, has rapidly expanded across many scientific disciplines. Like other fields, fisheries research would benefit significantly from broader use of this emerging technology but has lagged behind other disciplines. Like the implementation of satellite and aircraft-based remote sensing technology in previous decades brought a greater understanding of large-scale spatial patterns and processes, UAS technology has the potential to put those tools in the hands of individual researchers that can implement them at finer spatial and temporal scales for a fraction of the cost. Our goal is to provide a ``how to'' for fisheries researchers interested in using UAS technology. We outline the necessary steps for any UAS project from choosing the appropriate platform and sensors to data acquisition and analysis. We also present the current ways UASs are being used in a fisheries research context, as well a potential future research directions. [A]Introduction Recently, the use of unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) has rapidly increased across many scientific disciplines. From the highly applied (agriculture and inspections) to the most basic research (ecology and geology) UASs offer a unique opportunity to collect data that was either very costly or impossible previously. However, while the prospect of high frequency, high quality, low-cost data is appealing, determining the right UAS platform, sensors, and data processing pipeline can create a high barrier to entry for many researchers interested in using UASs as a tool in their research. Our goal is to provide an introduction to implementing UAS technology in a fisheries research context. Since UAS technology is rapidly evolving, we will focus less on specific technologies and more on the general capabilities of UAS platforms, data acquisition and workflows, and current and potential applications to fisheries research.},

Indigenous communities have been sought out to provide Indigenous knowledge to mainstream science research programs.

The goal of this project is to present a framework for collaboration between mainstream science and Indigenous communities. Specifically, we are addressing an underrecognized role central to partnership, a boundary spanner, who acts as the fulcrum facilitating collaboration. To better understand the role of boundary spanners in collaborative projects, we engaged six boundary spanners who participated in semi-structured interviews and workshops. Emergent common experiences and perspectives of how boundary spanners can be supported and their role in collaborative projects were defined and articulated. The boundary spanners identified 10 characteristics that contribute to equitable partnership between mainstream science and Indigenous communities. From the perspective of the boundary spanners, they detailed how collaborative projects can be structured to increase long-term partnerships and community support of research projects. Equitable collaboration between Indigenous communities and mainstream science is frequently only achieved when individuals at the interface of the mainstream science and Indigenous community have a high level of cultural competency. Equally important is the support provided to the boundary spanners and early engagement of partner Indigenous communities. Through the use of story and metaphor, we highlight the voices of boundary spanners and how their contributions can best be used.},

Hatton               et al.               describe a general scaling law that relates total predator and prey biomass in terrestrial and aquatic animal communities (see the Perspective by Cebrian). They draw on data from many thousands of population counts of animal communities ranging from plankton to large mammals, across a wide range of biomes.

We show a robust scaling law that emerges uniquely at the level of whole ecosystems and is conserved across terrestrial and aquatic biomes worldwide. This pattern describes the changing structure and productivity of the predator-prey biomass pyramid, which represents the biomass of communities at different levels of the food chain. Scaling exponents of the relation between predator versus prey biomass and community production versus biomass are often near {$\frac{3}{4}$}, which indicates that very different communities of species exhibit similar high-level structure and function. This recurrent community growth pattern is remarkably similar to individual growth patterns and may hint at a basic process that reemerges across levels of organization.                                         RATIONALE               We assembled a global data set for community biomass and production across 2260 large mammal, invertebrate, plant, and plankton communities. These data reveal two ecosystem-level power law scaling relations: (i) predator biomass versus prey biomass, which indicates how the biomass pyramid changes shape, and (ii) community production versus community biomass, which indicates how per capita productivity changes at a given level in the pyramid. Both relations span a wide range of ecosystems along large-scale biomass gradients. These relations can be linked theoretically to show how pyramid shape depends on flux rates into and out of predator-prey communities. In order to link community-level patterns to individual processes, we examined community size structure and, particularly, how the mean body mass of a community relates to its biomass.                                         RESULTS                                Across ecosystems globally, pyramid structure becomes consistently more bottom-heavy, and per capita production declines with increasing biomass. These two ecosystem-level patterns both follow power laws with near {$\frac{3}{4}$} exponents and are shown to be robust to different methods and assumptions. These structural and functional relations are linked theoretically, suggesting that a common community-growth pattern influences predator-prey interactions and underpins pyramid shape. Several of these patterns are highly regular (                 R                 2                 {$>$} 0.80) and yet are unexpected from classic theories or from empirical relations at the population or individual level. By examining community size structure, we show these patterns emerge distinctly at the ecosystem level and independently from individual near {$\frac{3}{4}$} body-mass allometries.                                                        CONCLUSION               Systematic changes in biomass and production across trophic communities link fundamental aspects of ecosystem structure and function. The striking similarities that are observed across different kinds of systems imply a process that does not depend on system details. The regularity of many of these relations allows large-scale predictions and suggests high-level organization. This community-level growth pattern suggests a systematic form of density-dependent growth and is intriguing given the parallels it exhibits to growth scaling at the individual level, both of which independently follow near {$\frac{3}{4}$} exponents. Although we can make ecosystem-level predictions from individual-level data, we have yet to fully understand this similarity, which may offer insight into growth processes in physiology and ecology across the tree of life.                                                   African large-mammal communities are highly structured.                   In lush savanna, there are three times more prey per predator than in dry desert, a pattern that is unexpected and systematic.  [Photo: Amaury Laporte]                                                                         ,              Ecosystems exhibit surprising regularities in structure and function across terrestrial and aquatic biomes worldwide. We assembled a global data set for 2260 communities of large mammals, invertebrates, plants, and plankton. We find that predator and prey biomass follow a general scaling law with exponents consistently near {$\frac{3}{4}$}. This pervasive pattern implies that the structure of the biomass pyramid becomes increasingly bottom-heavy at higher biomass. Similar exponents are obtained for community production-biomass relations, suggesting conserved links between ecosystem structure and function. These exponents are similar to many body mass allometries, and yet ecosystem scaling emerges independently from individual-level scaling, which is not fully understood.

  abstract = {Winter is thought to be a critical period for many fish in the ocean, but their ecology during this time tends to be poorly understood. We quantified the feeding ecology of juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) off the west coast of Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada, in autumn and winter to determine how seasonality could affect diet. Using stomach contents and stable isotopes, we tested the hypothesis that the winter diet of juvenile Chinook salmon differs from that of the autumn diet. Stomach-content data showed a shift from a primary reliance on amphipods in autumn to euphausiids in winter. This finding was generally corroborated by the stable isotope analysis, although mixing models suggested a greater contribution of fish prey to the diet in both autumn and winter. Understanding the diet of fish during winter may provide useful information for management as a first step in understanding the factors influencing mortality across life stages.},

In this study, the characterisation of immune cell populations in tissues of non-ISAV infected Atlantic salmon and during the early viraemia of ISAV was undertaken. Immunohistochemical investigations of spleen, head kidney and gills using monoclonal antibodies against recombinant proteins from MHC I, II and CD8 were performed on tissues from Atlantic salmon collected day 17 post-challenge in a cohabitant infection model. The localisations of MHC I and II in control salmon were consistent with previous reports but this study presents novel observations on the distribution of CD8 labelled cell populations in Atlantic salmon including the description of significant mucosal populations in the gills. The distribution of MHC I, MHC II and CD8 positive cell populations differed between control salmon and cohabitant salmon in the early stages of ISAV infection. The changes in MHC I labelled cells differed between organs in ISAV cohabitants but all investigated organs showed a decreased presence of MHC II labelled cells. Together with a clustering of CD8 labelled cells in the head kidney and a reduced presence of CD8 labelled cells in the gills, these observations support the early mobilisation of cellular immunity in the response of Atlantic salmon to ISAV infection. However, differences between the present study and the findings from studies investigating immune gene mRNA expression during ISAV infection suggest that viral strategies to interfere with protein expression and circumvent the host immune response could be operative in the early response to ISAV infection.},

The sampling resolutions used are common to many marine benthic studies (i.e., in order of increasing resolution: video transects; grab sampling; small-core sampling). We investigate whether: (1) loss of information about the finer scale inhibits our ability to detect relationships between large-scale (e.g., environmental) processes and communities at coarser resolutions; or (2) information collected at the finer scale is noisy and obscures detection of large-scale relationships; or (3) the same information is available from all 3 resolutions. We detected fewest relationships between environmental variables and communities at our coarsest resolution; this has important implications to study designs utilising video methods. The results of this study suggest that finding an `appropriate' scale of sampling for impact assessment may not be a question that should be concerning us. Rather, multiscale modelling and sampling may provide us with an increased ability to detect and interpret large-scale relationships. \textcopyright{} 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Traditional univariate measures of diversity, species richness, and evenness were not statistically able to separate contaminated from uncontaminated regions, although trends were evident. Within the nematode community, there were changes in the feeding mode between sites (diatoms feeders, predators, selective and nonselective feeders), although they were not correlated to the change in organic carbon content nor the silt-clay fraction. Multivariate approaches using principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS) signatures were able to identify and quantify the sites affected by different stressors. In response to sewage stress the community structure changed, but this was not reflected in the k-dominance curves or other univariate measures. Since the PLS method defines a signature based on the species present in the community, it was able to identify other sites impacted by sewage and provide a measure of degree of effect. Those sites identified as having a {$>$}10\% sewage-related community were revisited, and evidence of sewage discharges were found.},

Most authors now suggest that sustainability is best defined as the ability to sustain goods and services to human society, with social and economic factors to be considered along with environmental impacts. The result has been that each group (scientists, economists, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), etc.) defines ``sustainable seafood'' using whatever criteria it considers most important, and the same fish product may be deemed sustainable by one group and totally unsustainable by another one. We contend, however, that there is now extensive evidence that an ecological focus alone does not guarantee long-term sustainability of any form and that seafood sustainability must consistently take on a socio-ecological perspective if it is to be effective across cultures and in the future. The sustainability of seafood production depends not on the abundance of a fish stock, but on the ability of the fishery management system to adjust fishing pressure to appropriate levels. While there are scientific standards to judge the sustainability of food production, once we examine ecological, social, and economic aspects of sustainability, there is no unique scientific standard.},

We determined the structure of protistan assemblages throughout the Inlet during July 1995 at times of successive neap and spring tides.

These identi\textregistered cations were either con\textregistered rmed or rejected by temporal analyses of protistan assemblages based on weekly sampling at two \textregistered xed positions, one in Saanich Inlet and one in Sidney Channel from May through October 1997. Results of both studies supported the hypothesis that the presence of a suite of diatom species, including most Chaetoceros spp., a large-celled variant of Skeletonema costatum and Thalassiosira rotula indicates the intrusion of water with elevated levels of dissolved inorganic nitrogen into Saanich Inlet from the Strait of Georgia. This indicator group of species contained additional species, but not all were observed in large numbers in 1997. Many of these species are important components of the laminated sediments of Saanich Inlet, whose presence is probably indicative of paleo-environmental conditions in the southern Strait of Georgia rather than Saanich Inlet. Effects of tidal cycles on dino\textasciimacron agellate and other \textasciimacron agellated cells, exclusive of mastigophorans, were inconclusive and additional studies are required to elucidate details of their ecology in waters of the southern Strait of Georgia. q 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

A comparison of 50 watersheds in the remote Great Bear Rainforest of British Columbia's central coast in Canada shows that salmon influence nutrient loading to plants, shifting plant communities toward nutrient-rich species, which in turn decreases plant diversity. These effects are mediated by interactions between salmon density and the physical characteristics of watersheds. Predicting how salmon affect terrestrial ecosystems is central to conservation plans that aim to better integrate ecosystem values into resource management.},

A hierarchical before\textendash after, control\textendash impact design was used with the addition of chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta (Walbaum in Artedi, 1792)) carcasses to forest sites along 11 streams on the central coast of British Columbia, Canada.

Treatment effects for \%N were typically greater than for d15N. Nitrogen isotope signatures at carcass sites were highly variable (d15N range = 30.1\textperthousand ) and were mediated by plant species, stream salmon density, carcass mass, and individual plant foliar \%N. These results show that understory plants use N from salmon during an important period of plant growth many months after carcasses were deposited in riparian areas. However, they also indicate that habitat variation across spatial scales from individual plants to streams needs to be considered when estimating the contribution of salmon to plant nutrition.},

Using both species-based and individual approaches, we found size structuring in this forest soil community, and transient community-wide doubling of standing biomass in response to energy pulses from Pacific salmon carcasses. One group of species were clear outliers in the middle of the size spectrum relationship: larval calliphorid and dryomyzid flies, which specialize on salmon carcasses, and which showed a tenfold increase in biomass in their size class when salmon were available. Thus, salmon subsidize their escape from the size spectrum. These results suggest that using a size-based perspective of resource subsidies can provide new insights into the structure and functioning of food webs.},

  abstract = {Kelp forests are in decline across much of their range due to place-specific combinations of local and global stressors. Declines in kelp abundance can lead to cascading losses of biodiversity and productivity with far-reaching ecological and socioeconomic consequences. The Salish Sea is a hotspot of kelp diversity where many species of kelp provide critical habitat and food for commercially, ecologically, and culturally important fish and invertebrate species. However, like other regions, kelp forests in much of the Salish Sea are in rapid decline. Data gaps and limited long-term monitoring have hampered attempts to identify and manage for specific drivers of decline, despite the documented urgency to protect these important habitats. To address these knowledge gaps, we gathered a focus group of experts on kelp in the Salish Sea to identify perceived direct and indirect stressors facing kelp forests. We then conducted a comprehensive literature review of peer-reviewed studies from the Salish Sea and temperate coastal ecosystems worldwide to assess the level of support for the pathways identified by the experts, and we identified knowledge gaps to prioritize future research. Our results revealed major research gaps within the Salish Sea and highlighted the potential to use expert knowledge for making informed decisions in the region. We found high support for the pathways in the global literature, with variable consensus on the relationship between stressors and responses across studies, confirming the influence of local ecological, oceanographic, and anthropogenic contexts and threshold effects on stressor\textendash response relationships. Finally, we prioritized areas for future research in the Salish Sea. This study demonstrates the value expert opinion has to inform management decisions. These methods are readily adaptable to other ecosystem management contexts, and the results of this case study can be immediately applied to kelp management.},

However, it can be difficult to assign causation between the initiation and development of eco-cultural innovations like clam gardens and the proliferation of human societies due to the temporal uncertainties associated with both. Here, we bring together data on the shape of the local relative sea level curve, clam garden wall elevation as determined by GIS and drone imagery, radiocarbon dates of clam garden walls, and ecological and archaeological field observations, to assign proxy ages for the clam garden walls of different tidal heights in Kanish and Waiatt Bay on northern Quadra Island, British Columbia, Canada. These data, combined with our mapping and dating of settlement sites, demonstrate a temporal relationship between clam garden building effort and the densification of human settlements. In Kanish Bay, where we have high resolution data, clam gardens begin to be constructed in significant numbers at least 3,800 years ago; this corresponds to a time of increased establishment of large human settlements. The corresponding increase in settlements and clam gardens reflects both the need to increase sustainable food production and the larger number of people who could sustain the ecological and social foundations of the production system. The correlation between number and area of clam gardens and the number of new, large settlements continues until {$\sim$}2000 years ago. After this time, existing settlements increase in size, but no additional large settlements were established. New clam gardens continue to be built but in seemingly lower numbers. This shift in settlements and clam gardens suggest that a threshold in social-ecological carrying capacity may have been reached in this land- and seascape. In the last few centuries, there is a dramatic decline in the number of clam gardens and evidence of human settlement, corresponding to social and ecological changes associated with European colonization. Taken together, these data demonstrate the strong linkages among Indigenous peoples, their lands and seas, and resilient food systems over the millennia.},

Here, we bring together data on the shape of the local relative sea level curve, clam garden wall elevation as determined by GIS and drone imagery, radiocarbon dates of clam garden walls, and ecological and archaeological field observations, to assign proxy ages for the clam garden walls of different tidal heights in Kanish and Waiatt Bay on northern Quadra Island, British Columbia, Canada. These data, combined with our mapping and dating of settlement sites, demonstrate a temporal relationship between clam garden building effort and the densification of human settlements. In Kanish Bay, where we have high resolution data, clam gardens begin to be constructed in significant numbers at least 3,800 years ago; this corresponds to a time of increased establishment of large human settlements. The corresponding increase in settlements and clam gardens reflects both the need to increase sustainable food production and the larger number of people who could sustain the ecological and social foundations of the production system. The correlation between number and area of clam gardens and the number of new, large settlements continues until {$\sim$}2000 years ago. After this time, existing settlements increase in size, but no additional large settlements were established. New clam gardens continue to be built but in seemingly lower numbers. This shift in settlements and clam gardens suggest that a threshold in social-ecological carrying capacity may have been reached in this land- and seascape. In the last few centuries, there is a dramatic decline in the number of clam gardens and evidence of human settlement, corresponding to social and ecological changes associated with European colonization. Taken together, these data demonstrate the strong linkages among Indigenous peoples, their lands and seas, and resilient food systems over the millennia.},

  abstract = {The extensive intertidal flats along Eighty-mile Beach in North-western Australia appear to be monotonous and homogeneous and seem ideally suited to study tidal zonation in macrozoo-benthic communities and their possible correlates with characteristics of the sediment. In October 1999, we sampled benthic invertebrates and sediments at a total of 895 sampling stations distributed over six different locations, each location separated by 15 km of unsampled foreshore along Eighty-mile Beach. To test for the presence or absence of patterns of tidal zonation (distinct height-related zones of specific sediment grain sizes or zoobenthic taxonomic groups) or patchiness (distinct patches of specific sediment grain sizes or zoobenthic taxonomic groups not related to tidal height) each location was divided into three along-shore sections and each section (transect) was examined at two or three tidal heights. Zonation was observed for sediment grain sizes. Sediments were coarser at the highest intertidal level and finer towards the low water line. Benthic assemblages also differed among tidal heights, but in terms of species-composition the differences were not consistent among the locations. Each location supported a unique collection of benthic invertebrates. Therefore the hypothesis of the presence of distinct zones of specific species or zoobenthic taxonomic groups was rejected; the presence of benthic patches was confirmed. The distribution of sediments and the composition of benthic assemblages were surprisingly poorly correlated compared to those reported in 12 previous quantitative studies around the world. One possible explanation might be that super-cyclone Vance, which hit the study-area only six months before this study, contributed to this poor correlation. Alternatively, the poor correlation may indicate that biotic interactions are more important than the assumed abiotic structuring.},

These changes in components of the Earth's biodiversity cause concern for ethical and aesthetic reasons, but they also have a strong potential to alter ecosystem properties and the goods and services they provide to humanity. Ecological experiments, observations, and theoretical developments show that ecosystem properties depend greatly on biodiversity in terms of the functional characteristics of organisms present in the ecosystem and the distribution and abundance of those organisms over space and time. Species effects act in concert with the effects of climate, resource availability, and disturbance regimes in influencing ecosystem properties.

Here we use a suite of meta-analyses of published data to show that the effects of species loss on productivity and decomposition\textemdash two processes important in all ecosystems\textemdash are of comparable magnitude to the effects of many other global environmental changes. In experiments, intermediate levels of species loss (21\textendash 40\%) reduced plant production by 5\textendash 10\%, comparable to previously documented effects of ultraviolet radiation and climate warming. Higher levels of extinction (41\textendash 60\%) had effects rivalling those of ozone, acidification, elevated CO2 and nutrient pollution. At intermediate levels, species loss generally had equal or greater effects on decomposition than did elevated CO2 and nitrogen addition. The identity of species lost also had a large effect on changes in productivity and decomposition, generating a wide range of plausible outcomes for extinction. Despite the need for more studies on interactive effects of diversity loss and environmental changes, our analyses clearly show that the ecosystem consequences of local species loss are as quantitatively significant as the direct effects of several global change stressors that have mobilized major international concern and remediation efforts},

The biogeographic composition of macroalgae at Hansneset was rather similar to that of northeastern Greenland, but different from that of northern Norway, which has a higher proportion of temperate species.

  abstract = {Previous work with the meiofauna in the Ria Formosa Lagoon has shown that it is possible to use the community structure as an indicator of recent or ongoing contamination events. However, the meiofauna require a substantial degree of taxonomic expertise to identify to the species level, whereas the macrofauna are much more readily identified. In a parallel study, the macrofauna at the same sites as the previous work were identified and evaluated with univariate (diversity, evenness measures) and multivariate statistical methods (PCA). Unlike in the previous study, the diversity decreased as the grain surface area increased and the sediments became muddier. However, there was no change in the evenness of the macrofauna across the same sites. The number of species also reflected the change from sandy (11\textendash 17 per site) to muddy (only 1 species present) sediments. PCA identified the grain surface area as the major controlling factor in explaining the variance, although there was a nonstochastic effect with positive values of principal component (PC) 1 only present in samples with a low TOC ({$<$}2\%) or {$<$}10\% of grains less than 63 \textmu m diameter. These organisms were suspension feeders as opposed to deposit feeders that loaded negatively on PC1. The second PC characterized a ``contamination'' gradient with species that have been identified as indicators of pollution. However, these sites did not correlate with the known sewage gradients of the region and suggest the community was responding to another type of contamination gradient. In conclusion, while the macrofauna were easier to identify and quantify, they do not lend themselves as well as the meiofauna to anthropogenic stress identification.},

  abstract = {Guided by deeply held cultural values, First Nations in Canada are rapidly regaining legal authority to manage natural resources. We present a research collaboration among academics, tribal government, provincial and federal government, resource managers, conservation practitioners, and community leaders supporting First Nation resource authority and stewardship. First, we present results from a molecular genetics study of grizzly bears inhabiting an important conservation area within the territory of the Heiltsuk First Nation in coastal British Columbia. Noninvasive hair sampling occurred between 2006 and 2009 in the Koeye watershed, a stronghold for grizzly bears, salmon, and Heiltsuk people. Molecular demographic analyses revealed a regionally significant population of bears, which congregate at the Koeye each salmon-spawning season. There was a minimum of 57 individual bears detected during the study period. Results also pointed to a larger than expected source geography for salmon-feeding bears in the study area ({$>$} 1000 km{$^2$}), as well as early evidence of a declining trend in the bear population potentially explained by declining salmon numbers. Second, we demonstrate and discuss the power of integrating scientific research with a culturally appropriate research agenda developed by indigenous people. Guided explicitly by principles from Gvi'ilas or customary law, this research methodology is coupled with Heiltsuk culture, enabling results of applied conservation science to involve and resonate with tribal leadership in ways that have eluded previous scientific endeavors. In this context, we discuss the effectiveness of research partnerships that, from the outset, create both scientific programs and integrated communities of action that can implement change. We argue that indigenous resource management requires collaborative approaches like ours, in which science-based management is embedded within a socially and culturally appropriate context. We emerge not only with a set of guiding principles for resource management by the Heiltsuk, but a broadly applicable strategy that fosters intimacy with traditional lands and resources and provides a powerful engine for conservation.},

Five species were captured frequently throughout the study. Captures of the dasyurids Dasykaluta rosamondae and Ningaui timealeyi increased when juveniles entered the population following seasonal breeding. Captures of the saxicoline rodent, Zyzomys argurus, showed relatively small fluctuations whereas populations of two other rodents, Pseudomys hermannsburgensis and Mus musculus, had 40 to 50 fold increase in captures between troughs and peaks, with peaks for both species occurring 18 months after the first of two major rainfall events. Species showed marked differences in their response to capture in Elliott and pitfall trap types; consequently, assemblage composition was compared in only eight habitats where both types were employed. The small mammal assemblage adjacent to a rocky breakaway differed to that on alluvial soil adjacent to the major creek, and to those in several Triodia-dominated habitats on the Abydos sandplain. The number of small mammal species and individuals in Triodia-dominated habitats decreased markedly after fire while similar habitats that remained unburnt over the same period showed an increase in both species and capture rates of individuals.},

  abstract = {Many studies have revealed that anchovy has exhibited large variability in population size on decadal timescales. However, such works concerning anchovy population are mainly based on short historical catch records. In order to understand the causes of variability in fish stocks (natural and/or anthropogenic) and calibrate the error between catches and standing stocks, it is essential to develop long-term time series of fish stocks from the time when human impacts are minimal or negligible. Well preserved fish scales from sediment record are regarded as useful indicators revealing the history of fish population dynamics over the last centuries. Anchovy scales was first analyzed over the Yellow Sea and East China Sea and the largest abundance was found in the central South Yellow Sea where is regarded as the largest overwintering ground for Japanese anchovy (Engraulis japonicas). Thus in the central South Yellow Sea, two cores covering the last 150 years were collected for estimating fish scale flux. The scale deposition rate (SDR) records show that the decadal scale SDRs were obviously coherent between cores with independent chronologies. The calibration of downcore SDRs to the standing stocks of anchovy further validated that SDR is a reliable proxy to reconstruct the long-term anchovy population dynamic in the central South Yellow Sea where anoxic conditions prevail in the sediment. When assembled with other productivity proxies, it would be expected that SDR could be associated with changes in oceanic productivity and may make a contribution to determine the forcing factors and elucidate the mechanism of the process in future.},

While several examples illustrate the utility of applying TEK in these contexts, wider application of TEKderived information remains elusive. In part, this is due to continued inertia in favor of established scientific practices and the need to describe TEK in Western scientific terms. In part, it is also due to the difficulty of accessing TEK, which is rarely written down and must in most cases be documented as a project on its own prior to its incorporation into another scientific undertaking. This formidable practical obstacle is exacerbated by the need to use social science methods to gather biological data, so that TEK research and application becomes a multidisciplinary undertaking. By examining case studies involving bowhead whales, beluga whales, and herring, this paper describes some of the benefits of using TEK in scientific and management contexts. It also reviews some of the methods that are available to do so, including semi-directive interviews, questionnaires, facilitated workshops, and collaborative field projects.

This study aims to test the use of some of the most widely common benthic biotic indices for assessing the environmental quality of Montevideo's coastal zone at a seasonal scale against many physicochemical variables. From all the evaluated indices, AMBI appears to be the most suitable one to assess the environmental quality. The study also allowed us to infer the most relevant physicochemical variables: protein, lipid and heavy metal sediment concentration. Additionally, site-specific threshold effect levels for heavy metals and biopolymers were established, which appear to be useful to determine tolerable levels of such stressors in future assessments or monitoring programs for the study area.},

  abstract = {We reviewed 24 sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) nursery lake experiments that involved whole-lake fertilization with appropriate treatment and control years. We found that: 21 of 21 studies showed that fertilization was associated with increased chlorophyll a concentrations, 16 of 16 showed increased zooplankton biomasses, 16 of 16 demonstrated increased average smolt weights, and 11 of 13 showed increased smolt biomasses. Studies involving assessments of egg-to-smolt survival were rare, but all (4 of 4) showed increased survival rates. Studies involving increased smolt-to-adult survival (i.e., marine survival) were even rarer, but all (3 of 3) showed that lake fertilization and increased smolt size were associated with increased marine survival. Several fertilization studies reported problems, and some offered solutions. For instance, when whole-lake fertilization stimulated the growth of blue-green algae, fertilizer with higher nitrogen to phosphorus ratios was used to control the problem. Conversely, when high nitrogen to phosphorus ratios were associated with blooms of ungrazable diatoms, notably Rhizosolenia eriensis, reduced nitrate concentrations were recommended. To date, solutions designed to constrain the growth of both blue-green algae and Rhizosolenia blooms remain elusive. Some studies showed that when both mysids (large invertebrate planktivores) and juvenile sockeye inhabit the same lake, sockeye suffer from a competitive disadvantage and mysids consume 80\textendash 90\% of the available zooplanktonic food production. Similarly, a small number of studies demonstrated that competition from sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) adversely affected sockeye growth rates, and although the problem remains unresolved, ongoing work in lakes containing kokanee (O. nerka), suggests that stocked cutthroat trout (Salmo clarki) may be capable of controlling stickleback densities through predation. Despite all of these difficulties, in almost all cases, when lakes were fertilized with various mixtures of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus, pelagic food web bottom-up control was strong enough and predictable enough to ensure that sockeye smolt biomass increased. We conclude that sockeye nursery lake fertilization is a technique that can contribute usefully to both the enhancement and conservation of sockeye salmon populations.},

  abstract = {Anthropogenic activities have led to the biotic homogenization of many ecological communities, yet in coastal systems this phenomenon remains understudied. In particular, activities that locally affect marine habitat-forming foundation species may perturb habitat and promote species with generalist, opportunistic traits, in turn affecting spatial patterns of biodiversity. Here, we quantified fish diversity in seagrass communities across 89 sites spanning 6\textdegree{} latitude along the Pacific coast of Canada, to test the hypothesis that anthropogenic disturbances homogenize (i.e., lower beta-diversity) assemblages within coastal ecosystems. We test for patterns of biotic homogenization at sites within different anthropogenic disturbance categories (low, medium, and high) at two spatial scales (within and across regions) using both abundance- and incidence-based beta-diversity metrics. Our models provide clear evidence that fish communities in high anthropogenic disturbance seagrass areas are homogenized relative to those in low disturbance areas. These results were consistent across within-region comparisons using abundance- and incidencebased measures of beta-diversity, and in across-region comparisons using incidencebased measures. Physical and biotic characteristics of seagrass meadows also influenced fish beta-diversity. Biotic habitat characteristics including seagrass biomass and shoot density were more differentiated among high disturbance sites, potentially indicative of a perturbed environment. Indicator species and trait analyses revealed fishes associated with low disturbance sites had characteristics including stenotopy, lower swimming ability, and egg guarding behavior. Our study is the first to show biotic homogenization of fishes across seagrass meadows within areas of relatively high human impact. These results support the importance of targeting conservation efforts in low anthropogenic disturbance areas across land- and seascapes, as well as managing anthropogenic impacts in high activity areas.},

A total of 6616 individuals, comprising 89 species (30 families), were collected using a small seine net. In terms of number of species per family, Gobiidae (18 species) was the most diverse, followed by Engraulidae (nine species) and Leiognathidae (seven species). In terms of individuals, Engraulidae, Leiognathidae, Gerreidae, Atherinidae and Gobiidae were the dominant families. Species richness was significantly greater in the mangrove creek than at the two beach sites, and greater in the wet season than the dry season. Fish abundance (individuals per tow) was also greater in the wet season, with no significant differences among sites. On the other hand, biomass (weight per tow) was greater in the mangrove creek than the mangrove beach, but with no significant difference between seasons. Cluster and ordination analysis based on the number of individuals of each species demonstrated that the fish assemblage structures were markedly different between the beach and creek sites, the assemblages at the two beach sites being similar in the wet season. Most species were specific to a particular habitat type (or types), some occurring exclusively in the creek or beach sites, and some in both the mangrove sites. Such distributional differences were found even between species within a single family. The results indicated that creek and beach habitats function as nursery sites for different fish species, the former being utilized by a greater diversity of species than the latter.},

  abstract = {Ten beaches subjected to different wave action exposure were studied on the northwest coast of the Iberian Peninsula. According to descriptions of beach types (from very sheltered to very exposed) given by McLachlan (1980), five of the beaches studied were classified as sheltered and the other five as exposed beaches. The biochemical composition (proteins, lipids and carbohydrates) of sedimentary organic matter was analysed from the surface sediment down to a depth of 25 cm, between July and September 1997, at three tidal levels: high, medium, and low, at ebb tide. Biochemical compound concentrations were significantly higher in the sheltered than in the exposed beaches. Concentrations were, on average two, three and four times higher (for proteins, carbohydrates and lipids, respectively) in sheltered than in exposed sediments. The low hydrodynamic conditions of the sheltered beaches favoured the settlement of sedimentary organic matter. This is supported by the higher protein to carbohydrate ratio found in the exposed (12.3), in contrast with the sheltered localities (5.2). Sheltered but not exposed sediments were characterised by clear vertical profiles of protein, carbohydrate and lipid concentrations, with values on top approximately twice as high as in the deeper sediment layers. On the other hand, there were significant differences in the biochemical compound concentrations among tidal levels for both groups of intertidal localities, except for the protein concentrations in sheltered localities. Biochemical compound concentrations were higher at medium and low tidal levels for both sheltered and exposed beaches. In the three tidal levels, there was a significant negative relationship between the biopolymeric carbon and the intertidal slope. Thus, the biopolymeric carbon concentration decreased as the intertidal slope increased.},

  abstract = {Indigenous communities have actively managed their environments for millennia using a diversity of resource use and conservation strategies. Clam gardens, ancient rock-walled intertidal beach terraces, represent one example of an early mariculture technology that may have been used to improve food security and confer resilience to coupled human-ocean systems. We surveyed a coastal landscape for evidence of past resource use and management to gain insight into ancient resource stewardship practices on the central coast of British Columbia, Canada. We found that clam gardens are embedded within a diverse portfolio of resource use and management strategies and were likely one component of a larger, complex resource management system. We compared clam diversity, density, recruitment, and biomass in three clam gardens and three unmodified nonwalled beaches. Evidence suggests that butter clams (Saxidomus gigantea) had 1.96 times the biomass and 2.44 times the density in clam gardens relative to unmodified beaches. This was due to a reduction in beach slope and thus an increase in the optimal tidal range where clams grow and survive best. The most pronounced differences in butter clam density between nonwalled beaches and clam gardens were found at high tidal elevations at the top of the beach. Finally, clam recruits (0.5-2 mm in length) tended to be greater in clam gardens compared to nonwalled beaches and may be attributed to the addition of shell hash by ancient people, which remains on the landscape today. As part of a broader social-ecological system, clam garden sites were among several modifications made by humans that collectively may have conferred resilience to past communities by providing reliable and diverse access to food resources.},

Here, we test and use an alternative technique based on freely available computer vision software which allows general geoscientists to easily create accurate 3D models from field photographs taken with a consumer-grade camera. The approach integrates structure-from-motion (SfM) and multi-view-stereo (MVS) algorithms and, in contrast to traditional photogrammetry techniques, it requires little expertise and few control measurements, and processing is automated. To assess the precision of the results, we compare SfM-MVS models spanning spatial scales of centimeters (a hand sample) to kilometers (the summit craters of Piton de la Fournaise volcano) with data acquired from laser scanning and formal close-range photogrammetry. The relative precision ratio achieved by SfM-MVS (measurement precision : observation distance) is limited by the straightforward camera calibration model used in the software, but generally exceeds 1:1000 (i.e. centimeter-level precision over measurement distances of 10s of meters). We apply SfM-MVS at an intermediate scale, to determine erosion rates along a \textasciitilde 50-m-long coastal cliff. Seven surveys carried out over a year indicate an average retreat rate of 0.70{$\pm$}0.05 m a-1. Sequential erosion maps (at \textasciitilde 0.05 m grid resolution) highlight the spatio-temporal variability in the retreat, with semivariogram analysis indicating a correlation between volume loss and length scale. Compared with a laser scanner survey of the same site, SfM-MVS produced comparable data and reduced data collection time by \textasciitilde 80\%.},

We suggest that the current biomass of large fishes weighing 4\textendash 16 kg and 16\textendash 66 kg, respectively, is 97{$\cdot$}4\% and 99{$\cdot$}2\% lower than in the absence of fisheries exploitation. The results suggest that depletion of large fishes due to fisheries exploitation exceeds that described in many short-term studies.  6. Biomass of the contemporary North Sea fish community (defined as all fishes with body mass 64 g-66 kg) is 38\% lower than predicted in the absence of exploitation, while the mean turnover time is almost twice as fast (falls from 3{$\cdot$}5 to 1{$\cdot$}9 years) and 70\% less primary production is required to sustain it.  7. The increased turnover time of the fish community will lead to greater interannual instability in biomass and production, complicating management action and increasing the sensitivity of populations to environmental change.  8. This size-based method based on macroecological theory may provide a powerful new tool for setting ecosystem indicator reference levels, comparing fishing impacts in different ecosystems and for assessing the relative impacts of fishing and climate change.},

Population diet niche width was broad and similar across all lakes, contrasting with that of individual fish, which exhibited specialized diets in comparison with their population and other individuals. Overall, the degree of individual diet specialization was high compared with that of other fishes. The degree of individual diet specialization did not differ among study populations, although it was generally reduced in spring. Individual diet specialization was consistent across fish sizes despite observed shifts in diet composition with increasing fish length. Population diet composition varied among lakes but was consistent within lakes in all years during the 3-year study period with regard to season and fish size. The consistency and stability in measures of population diet niche width, degree of individual diet specialization, and population diet composition for Brook Trout indicate that these metrics provide useful tools for characterizing fish foraging and measuring how it changes in response to biotic and abiotic perturbations.},

  abstract = {Density dependence in demographic rates can strongly affect the dynamics of populations. However, the mechanisms generating density dependence (e.g., pr?dation) are also dynamic processes and may be influenced by local conditions. Understanding the manner in which local habitat features affect the occurrence and/or strength of density dependence will increase our understanding of population dynamics in heterogeneous environments. In this study I conducted two separate field experiments to investigate how local predator density and habitat complexity affect the occurrence and form of density-dependent mortality of juvenile rockfishes \{Sebastes spp.). I also used yearly censuses of rockfish populations on nearshore reefs throughout central California to evaluate mortality of juvenile rockfish at large spatial scales. Manipulations of predators (juvenile bocaccio, S. paucispinus) and prey (kelp, gopher, and black-and-yellow [KGB] rockfish, Sebastes spp.) demonstrated that increasing the density of predators altered their functional response and thus altered patterns of density dependence in mortality of their prey. At low densities of predators, the number of prey consumed per predator was a decelerating function, and mortality of prey was inversely density dependent. However, at high densities of predators, the number of prey killed per predator became an accelerating response, and prey mortality was directly density dependent. Results of field experiments and large-scale surveys both indicated that the strength of density-dependent mortality may also be affected by the structural complexity of the habitat. In small-scale field experiments, increased habitat complexity increased the strength of density dependent mortality. However, at large scales, increasing complexity resulted in a decrease in the strength of density dependence. I suggest that these differences resulted from scale dependent changes in the predatory response that generated mortality. Whether increased habitat complexity leads to an increase or a decrease in the strength of density-dependent mortality may depend on how specific predatory responses (e.g., functional or aggregative) are altered by habitat complexity. Overall, the findings of this study suggest that rates of demographic density dependence and the resulting dynamics of local populations may largely depend upon attributes of the local habitat.

  abstract = {Bringing ecology to infection                            The tools we use to investigate infectious diseases tend to focus on specific one-host\textendash one-pathogen relationships, but pathogens often have complex life cycles involving many hosts. Johnson               et al.               review how such complexity is analyzed by community ecologists. Ecologists have the investigative tools to probe cause and effect relationships that change with spatial scale in multispecies communities. These techniques are used to monitor the ways in which communities change through time and to probe the heterogeneity that characterizes individuals, species, and assemblages\textemdash all issues that are also essential for disease specialists to understand.                                         Science               , this issue               10.1126/science.1259504                        ,                             BACKGROUND               Despite ongoing advances in biomedicine, infectious diseases remain a major threat to human health, economic sustainability, and wildlife conservation. This is in part a result of the challenges of controlling widespread or persistent infections that involve multiple hosts, vectors, and parasite species. Moreover, many contemporary disease threats involve interactions that manifest across nested scales of biological organization, from disease progression at the within-host level to emergence and spread at the regional level. For many such infections, complete eradication is unlikely to be successful, but a broader understanding of the community in which host-parasite interactions are embedded will facilitate more effective management. Recent advances in community ecology, including findings from traits-based approaches and metacommunity theory, offer the tools and concepts to address the complexities arising from multispecies, multiscale disease threats.                                         ADVANCES               Community ecology aims to identify the factors that govern the structure, assembly, and dynamics of ecological communities. We describe how analytical and conceptual approaches from this discipline can be used to address fundamental challenges in disease research, such as (i) managing the ecological complexity of multihost-multiparasite assemblages; (ii) identifying the drivers of heterogeneities among individuals, species, and regions; and (iii) quantifying how processes link across multiple scales of biological organization to drive disease dynamics. We show how a community ecology framework can help to determine whether infection is best controlled through ``defensive'' approaches that reduce host suitability or through ``offensive'' approaches that dampen parasite spread. Examples of defensive approaches are the strategic use of wildlife diversity to reduce host and vector transmission, and taking advantage of antagonism between symbionts to suppress within-host growth and pathology. Offensive approaches include the targeted control of superspreading hosts and the reduction of human-wildlife contact rates to mitigate spillover. By identifying the importance of parasite dispersal and establishment, a community ecology framework can offer additional insights about the scale at which disease should be controlled.                                         OUTLOOK               Ongoing technological advances are rapidly overcoming previous barriers in data quality and quantity for complex, multispecies systems. The emerging synthesis of ``disease community ecology'' offers the tools and concepts necessary to interpret these data and use that understanding to inform the development of more effective disease control strategies in humans and wildlife. Looking forward, we emphasize the increasing importance of tight integration among surveillance, community ecology analyses, and public health implementation. Building from the rich legacy of whole-system manipulations in community ecology, we further highlight the value of large-scale experiments for understanding host-pathogen interactions and designing effective control measures. Through this blending of data, theory, and analytical approaches, we can understand how interactions between parasites within hosts, hosts within populations, and host species within ecological communities combine to drive disease dynamics, thereby providing new ways to manage emerging infections.                                                   The community ecology of disease.                                        (                     A                     ) Interactions between parasites can complicate management. Among Tsimane villagers, treatment of hookworms increases infections by                     Giardia lamblia                     . (                     B                     ) Similarly, understanding how ecological communities of hosts assemble can help forecast changes in disease. Biodiversity losses can promote interactions between white-footed mice and deer ticks, leading to an increase in the risk of Lyme disease from                     Borrelia burgdorferi                     .                                                                      [Credits: (A) A. Pisor, CDC, F. Dubs; (B) J. Brunner, T. Shears, NIH]                                       ,              Infectious diseases often emerge from interactions among multiple species and across nested levels of biological organization. Threats as diverse as Ebola virus, human malaria, and bat white-nose syndrome illustrate the need for a mechanistic understanding of the ecological interactions underlying emerging infections. We describe how recent advances in community ecology can be adopted to address contemporary challenges in disease research. These analytical tools can identify the factors governing complex assemblages of multiple hosts, parasites, and vectors, and reveal how processes link across scales from individual hosts to regions. They can also determine the drivers of heterogeneities among individuals, species, and regions to aid targeting of control strategies. We provide examples where these principles have enhanced disease management and illustrate how they can be further extended.},

Results from two classical models (M = KL3 and M = aLb) were compared to results from the proposed model (M = BL2H) to find which one could be most accurately applied over the widest range of genetic, morphological and physiological states. A large database of physical measurements was analyzed. The newly proposed model decreased the variability in calculating weight by between 38 and 44\% as compared to the conventional fisheries model M = KL3 and was consistently more accurate than M = aLb. Condition factor K of the two salmon species studied increased with fish weight, while the B factor was generally invariant. With regards to the salmonids, the B factor indicates a type of bodily streamlining, important for swimming functions. A low B factor indicates a fish has less cross sectional area per unit length than a high B value fish has. As well, the B factor can be used to calculate girth. The new model can, therefore, be used to more accurately predict weight and physical state than other conventional models can. \textcopyright{} 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Therefore, in this paper, a methodology for the environmental evaluation of coastal rocky communities for the Bay of Biscay (NE Atlantic), the CFR index (Quality of Rocky Bottoms), is presented. This index is based on the analysis of seaweed communities throughout the depth gradient, from the intertidal to the shallow subtidal, through the combination of a multimetric approach, which combines the richness of characteristic macroalgae populations, their total cover, the presence of opportunistic species and the physiological condition of the whole macroalgae community. Quality thresholds for these indicators are based on both ecological data and expert judgment. Finally, a preliminary application of this metric to sites with theoretically good and bad environmental conditions is used to analyze the suitability of the index. As a result, the four selected indicators responded in a significant way to the pressure gradient tested, proving to be appropriate for the type of pressure analysed and obtaining coherent results in the final quality assessment with the CFR index. In conclusion, the CFR index has proved to be an effective tool for the assessment of the ecological quality of coastal rocky communities, based on the analysis of macroalgae assemblages.},

The cockle, Cerastoderma edule (L.) is the target of a commercial and artisanal \textregistered shery that occurs in intertidal and estuarine habitats across Northern Europe. Cockles are harvested either mechanically using tractor dredges or suction dredges or by large numbers of individual \textregistered shers using hand rakes. This study examined the effects of hand raking on the non-target species and under-sized cockles associated with intertidal cockle beds and the effects of size of the patch of sediment disturbed on subsequent recolonisation. Hand raking led to an initial three-fold increase in the damage rate of under-sized cockles compared with control plots. The communities in both small and large raked plots showed community changes relative to control plots 14 days after the initial disturbance. The small raked plots had recovered 56 days after the initial disturbance whereas the large raked plots remained in an altered state. Samples collected over a year later indicated that small-scale variations in habitat heterogeneity had been altered and suggest that while effects of hand raking may be signi\textregistered cant within a year, they are unlikely to persist beyond this time-scale unless there are larger long-lived species present within the community. q 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

We analysed sites in the Xingu river basin, Brazil, to reconstruct the 3D structure of the substrate and identify and map habitat classes important for maintaining fish assemblage biodiversity. From the digital models we calculated habitat complexity metrics including rugosity, slope and 3D fractal dimension. The UAV based SfM-MVS products were generated at a ground sampling distance (GSD) of 1.20\textendash 2.38 cm while the underwater photography produced a GSD of 1 mm. Our results show how these products provide spatially explicit complexity metrics, which are more comprehensive than conventional arbitrary cross sections. Shallow neural network classification of SfM-MVS products of substrate exposed in the dry season resulted in high accuracies across classes. UAV and underwater SfM-MVS is robust for quantifying freshwater habitat classes and complexity and should be chosen whenever possible over conventional methods (e.g., chain-and-tape) because of the repeatability, scalability and multi-dimensional nature of the products. The SfM-MVS products can be used to identify high priority freshwater sectors for conservation, species occurrences and diversity studies to provide a broader indication for overall fish species diversity and provide repeatability for monitoring change over time.},

  abstract = {Trophic indicators were used to compare two Malian freshwater reservoirs whose main differences are based on their different fishing pressures. Data were collected from a scientific survey of small-scale fishery landings conducted in 2002/2003. The trophic levels of fish species caught by artisanal fisheries are estimated from observations of scientific fishing or from the metabase Fishbase. Important differences exist in the trophic structure of both reservoirs. In Selingue (with high fishing pressure), very few top predators are found in the catches while the low trophic level fishes increase in total catches. In Manantali (with low fishing pressure), the top predators contribute twice as much to catches compared to Selingue. Hence, the mean trophic level of catches in Selingue (2.80) is lower than in Manantali (2.97). When comparing these results with those of study made in 1994/1995, it clearly appears that the effects of the fishing pressure in Selingue are obvious through a decrease of 0.12 in the mean trophic level while in Manantali this mean level has increased by 0.33 due to a recent strategic targeting of top predators. Trophic spectra seem to be relevant tools to characterize exploited fish communities from multi-specific and multi-gear small-scale fisheries catch data.},

Most notably, scientists now widely acknowledge that we live in a world dominated by humans, and therefore, the scientific underpinnings of conservation must include a consideration of the role of humans. Today's conservation science incorporates conservation biology into a broader interdisciplinary field that explicitly recognizes the tight coupling of social and natural systems. Emerging priorities include pursuing conservation within working landscapes, rebuilding public support, working with the corporate sector, and paying better attention to human rights and equity. We argue that in conservation, strategies must be promoted that simultaneously maximize the preservation of biodiversity and the improvement of human well-being.},

  abstract = {Behaviorally mediated trophic cascades (BMTCs) occur when the fear of predation among herbivores enhances plant productivity. Based primarily on systems involving small-bodied predators, BMTCs have been proposed as both strong and ubiquitous in natural ecosystems. Recently, however, synthetic work has suggested that the existence of BMTCs may be mediated by predator hunting mode, whereby passive (sit-and-wait) predators have much stronger effects than active (coursing) predators. One BMTC that has been proposed for a wide-ranging active predator system involves the reintroduction of wolves (Canis lupus) to Yellowstone National Park, USA, which is thought to be leading to a recovery of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) by causing elk (Cervus elaphus) to avoid foraging in risky areas. Although this BMTC has been generally accepted and highly popularized, it has never been adequately tested. We assessed whether wolves influence aspen by obtaining detailed demographic data on aspen stands using tree rings and by monitoring browsing levels in experimental elk exclosures arrayed across a gradient of predation risk for three years. Our study demonstrates that the historical failure of aspen to regenerate varied widely among stands (last recruitment year ranged from 1892 to 1956), and our data do not indicate an abrupt cessation of recruitment. This pattern of recruitment failure appears more consistent with a gradual increase in elk numbers rather than a rapid behavioral shift in elk foraging following wolf extirpation. In addition, our estimates of relative survivorship of young browsable aspen indicate that aspen are not currently recovering in Yellowstone, even in the presence of a large wolf population. Finally, in an experimental test of the BMTC hypothesis we found that the impacts of elk browsing on aspen demography are not diminished in sites where elk are at higher risk of predation by wolves. These findings suggest the need to further evaluate how trophic cascades are mediated by predator\textendash prey life history and ecological context.},

Sampling this environmental DNA (eDNA) is a potentially powerful means of assessing whole biological communities, a significant advance over the manual methods of environmental sampling that have historically dominated marine ecology and related fields. Here, we estimate the vertebrate fauna in a 4.5-million-liter mesocosm aquarium tank at the Monterey Bay Aquarium of known species composition by sequencing the eDNA from its constituent seawater. We find that it is generally possible to detect mitochondrial DNA of bony fishes sufficient to identify organisms to taxonomic familyor genus-level using a 106 bp fragment of the 12S ribosomal gene. Within bony fishes, we observe a low false-negative detection rate, although we did not detect the cartilaginous fishes or sea turtles present with this fragment. We find that the rank abundance of recovered eDNA sequences correlates with the abundance of corresponding species' biomass in the mesocosm, but the data in hand do not allow us to develop a quantitative relationship between biomass and eDNA abundance. Finally, we find a low false-positive rate for detection of exogenous eDNA, and we were able to diagnose nonnative species' tissue in the food used to maintain the mesocosm, underscoring the sensitivity of eDNA as a technique for community-level ecological surveys. We conclude that eDNA has substantial potential to become a core tool for environmental monitoring, but that a variety of challenges remain before reliable quantitative assessments of ecological communities in the field become possible.},

In the past, culture-dependent methods have been the primary choice to investigate bacterial diversity. However, using cultureindependent high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes has greatly facilitated studies exploring the microbial compositions and dynamics associated with health and diseases. These culture-independent DNA-based studies generate large-scale data sets that describe the microbial composition of a certain niche. Consequently, understanding microbial diversity becomes of greater importance when investigating the composition, function, and dynamics of the microbiota associated with health and diseases. Even though there is no general agreement on which diversity index is the best to use, diversity indices have been used to compare the diversity among samples and between treatments with controls. Tools such as the ShannonWeaver index and Simpson index can be used to describe population diversity in samples. The purpose of this review is to explain the principles of diversity indices, such as ShannonWeaver and Simpson, to aid general microbiologists in better understanding bacterial communities. In this review, important questions concerning microbial diversity are addressed. Information from this review should facilitate evidence-based strategies to explore microbial communities.},

These contrasting forces of increasing associate diversity and suppressing competitor diversity have rarely been examined experimentally with respect to disturbance. In a benthic marine community in central California, where native oysters are a foundation species, we tested how disturbance influenced overall species richness, evenness, and diversity. Surprisingly, overall diversity did not peak across a disturbance gradient because, as disturbance decreased, decreases in overall species evenness opposed increases in overall species richness. Decreasing disturbance intensity (high oyster abundance) led to increasing species richness of sessile and mobile species combined. This increase was due to the facilitation of secondary sessile and mobile species in the presence of oysters. In contrast, decreasing disturbance intensity and high oyster abundance decreased the evenness of sessile and mobile species. Three factors likely contributed to this decreased evenness: oysters reduced abundances of primary sessile species due to space competition; oysters supported more rare mobile species; and oysters disproportionately increased the relative abundance of a few common mobile species. Our results highlight the need for further studies on how disturbance can differentially affect the evenness and richness of different functional groups, and ultimately how these differences affect the relationship between overall diversity and ecosystem function.},

  abstract = {Methods for wetland bioassessment using macroinvertebrates are not well developed. Two of the most controversial issues in stream bioassessment, subsampling and taxonomic resolution, have yet to be quantitatively addressed for wetlands. Using a multivariate approach, we evaluated the efficacy of family-, genus-, and species-level assemblage data in reflecting the environment and distinguishing impaired sites from the reference condition. We used 5 basic levels of subsampling (100-, 200-, and 300-organism fixed counts; 10\% and 25\% fixed areas), an integrated subsample requiring a minimum fixed count and fixed area (100\&10\%), and 100-count and 10\%-area subsamples coupled with a supplementary large-rare (LR) search. Data were obtained from 1.5-m2 composite samples collected from 126 plots along a 10-km-long eutrophication gradient in the Florida Everglades. Our results suggest that effectiveness of subsampling depended more upon the minimum number of individuals retained than minimum area or proportion of the sample picked. Fixed-area subsamples were generally less efficient than fixed counts, with 200- and 300-individual fixed counts resulting in significantly greater assemblage\textendash environment relationships and much higher accuracy in detecting impairment than 10\% fixed area, despite averaging similar numbers of individuals. The greatest improvement with increasing subsample size was observed between fixed counts of 100 and 200 individuals; detecting impairment, in particular, was not markedly improved with subsample sizes Ͼ200 individuals. Supplementing subsamples with a LR search resulted in only very slight improvements in assemblage\textendash environment relationships, but was effective in improving prediction accuracy, particularly for family-level data. However, family-level assemblage\textendash environment relationships and abilities to detect impairment were inferior to genus- and species-level data, regardless of subsample size. Species-level data performed best, primarily because of the large proportion (Ͼ20\%) of total species belonging to Chironomidae. The potential importance of Chironomidae to wetland bioassessment was further revealed through an evaluation of a tiered-taxonomic approach, which showed that non-Chironomidae family-level data tiered with species-level Chironomidae data produced results very similar to those obtained using genus- or species-level data exclusively. Our results suggest that fixed counts Ն200 or integrated fixed-area/fixed-count approaches that consistently obtain a minimum of 200 individuals should be considered as minimum subsample sizes for wetlands. We additionally advocate LR searches and recommend genus- or species-level taxonomy, particularly for the Chironomidae.},

About 50\% of the variation in total catches was explained by capture of hatchery-reared fish for red sea bream, and 29\textendash 38\% for flounder. However, the scope for increased production was limited by carrying capacity, particularly at release sites. Replacement of wild fish by hatchery-reared juveniles was suggested in one case. The comparative analysis of macro-scale catch history revealed that the average contribution of hatchery-reared fish was 9.5\% for red sea bream and 11.7\% for flounder, and the global dynamics of wild populations does not appear to be linked to stock enhancement activities. Our results suggest the need for a cautious approach to stock enhancement programmes. We also address the biological potential, the limitations, and the future prospects of marine stock enhancement.},

  abstract = {The Katun River originates in the steppe of the Altai Mountains in Siberia. One of the major headwaters of the Ob River, the Katun is considered central to the culture of the indigenous Altaians. The Katun Valley contains large numbers of important cultural sites, dating from the Neolithic and representing some of the earliest human settlement in Russia. Modern-day Altaians still observe traditional ceremonies honoring the river and springs throughout the watershed and utilize traditional ecological knowledge in their management of the land and water resources. Russian and international scientists have identified the Altai Mountains as a region of high plant diversity and endemism, and as important habitat for endangered species such as the snow leopard. The Katun River itself contains species of threatened and endangered fishes, and its headwaters are part of the unusual Mongolian ichthyofaunal province that is characterized by high levels of endemism. The same regions are considered by the Altaian people to be special or sacred and are recognized by Western scientists as having great value for conservation. During the era of perestroika, a hydroelectric dam was to be built on the Katun. The large dam, a vestige of the earlier Soviet plan for the Project of the Century, would have devastated significant agricultural, ecological, recreational, and cultural resources. The indigenous Altaian people would have lost much of their sacred and cultural landscape. The Katun dam project united indigenous people, well-known Siberian writers, and scientists in protest, which became so heated that it engaged the international community, with lasting effects on Russian society. The magnitude of the protest illustrates the importance of the Altai Mountain region to all of Russia. The active participation of indigenous Altaians reflected their traditional willingness to take action against political decisions that negatively impacted the environmental, cultural, and religious values of their homeland. Their involvement also reflected the new wave of awareness under perestroika that underscored a greater respect and autonomy for indigenous peoples in Russia.},

Catch rate (no. of fish trap- min-1) was significantly (K-WANOVA on ranked data, H4df = 24.79; p {$<$} 0.001) greater at shorter soak times, and larger size classes ({$>$} 45 mm TL) of fish were relatively more abundant (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, p {$<$} 0.0001) in collections from double-funnel cylindrical traps (volume = 10,330 cm3) compared to rectangular traps having about twice the volume and a single funnel opening. We estimated entry and escape rates by adding marked fish to traps at initial densities of 30, 60, and 120 trap-' and measuring changes in the numbers of marked and unmarked fish in each trap type at soak times ranging from 15 to 120 min during the flood stage of the tidal cycle. Escape rate was almost twice as great from the two-funnel cylindrical traps (0.77 fish min-') than from the single-funnel rectangular type (0.42 fish min-1) but entry rates did not differ significantly (K-WANOVA, H4df = 0.06; p = 0.813) between trap types. Escape rate increased and entry rate decreased as fish density within traps was increased. Escape rates were highest immediately following immersion of the traps, but approached a constant value after 30 min. Trap-specific rates of entry and escape can be affected by a variety of factors including physical characteristics of different trap types, method and timing of trap deployment, and fish behavior. Catch data from minnow traps are unlikely to be useful in measuring relative abundance of mummichogs among habitats unless very short soak times ( 60 min) are used and calibration tests are performed. Use of longer soak times virtually ignores the dynamics involved in determining catch, and is unlikely to provide accurate information on either abundance or size distribution of mummichogs from tidal marsh habitats.},

We describe a general approach to estimation and inference for additive models of this type.

Both pointwise and uniform confidence bands are introduced; the uniform bands are based on the Hotelling (1939) tube approach.

We describe three estimation methods for such applications that have been recently incorporated into the R package quantreg: the Powell (1986) estimator for fixed censoring, and two methods for random censoring, one introduced by Portnoy (2003), and the other by Peng and Huang (2008).

  abstract = {Fishermen often anecdotally report an unexpected increase of fish caught in small tributary streams during floods, presumably due to refuge-seeking behavior from the main stem. From a population perspective, this implies the significance of refuge habitats and connectivity for population viability against natural disturbances. Despite the plausibility, however, surprisingly few studies have examined the tributary refuge hypothesis, mainly due to the difficulty in field survey during floods. Here, we made use of a large-scale controlled flood to assess whether fishes move into tributaries during flooding in the main stem. A planned water release from the Satsunai River Dam located on Hokkaido Island in Japan rapidly increased the main stem discharge by more than 20fold. Before, during, and after flooding censuses in four tributaries provided evidence of the refugeseeking behavior of fishes from the main stem. For example, more than 10 Dolly Varden char, a salmonid fish, were caught in a tributary during the flood, even though almost no individuals were captured before or after the flood. The fish responded immediately to the flooding, suggesting the need for studies during disturbances. In addition, the likelihood of refuge movements varied among tributaries, suggesting the importance of local environmental differences between tributary and the main stem habitats. This is the first study to experimentally confirm the tributary refuge hypothesis, and underscores the roles of habitat diversity and connectivity during disturbances, even though some habitats are not used during normal conditions.},

  abstract = {Theoretical work predicts that complex habitats allow more species to co-exist in a given area. However, more field studies are still needed to clarify this relationship, especially in intertidal habitats. Furthermore, the potential separate effects of surface complexity and area on species richness and abundance have rarely been addressed. We tested the hypotheses that a more complex substratum or larger surface area will support a greater number of individuals and species of mobile macrofauna on three rocky shores in Hong Kong. Surface complexity, assessed by using fractals, was an important factor in species\textendash area relationships. The number of species increased proportionally to habitat complexity and this relationship was homogeneous among different shores. Total abundance of animals, however, was more dependent on the available surface area. The slope of the size\textendash frequency distribution of animals in samples taken on surfaces with different fractal dimensions (D) was significantly steeper with an increase in fractal dimension, showing that the relative abundance of small animals increased with surface complexity. Thus, surface complexity and area may be important in determining different aspects of the macrofaunal community structure on rocky shores. The resulting increase in surface area on more rough surfaces may introduce bias in density and species number assessments when two-dimensional sampling units (i.e., quadrats) are employed. It is necessary, therefore, to account for the surface complexity in the design and interpretation of the results of benthic studies. Using D as an index of surface complexity is very useful, but also involves some practical problems, e.g., surfaces may be anisotropic and different methods may give different estimates of D. Therefore, these different methods need to be calibrated before comparisons of D values between them are meaningful.},

Have good policies for environmental management flowed out of ecological science? These important questions are rarely discussed by ecologists working on detailed studies of individual systems. Until we decide what we wish to achieve as ecologists we cannot define progress toward those goals. Ecologists desire to achieve an understanding of how the natural world operates, how humans have modified the natural world, and how to alleviate problems arising from human actions. Ecologists have made impressive gains over the past century in achieving these goals, but this progress has been uneven. Some sub-disciplines of ecology are well developed empirically and theoretically, while others languish for reasons that are not always clear. Fundamental problems can be lost to view as ecologists fiddle with unimportant pseudo-problems. Bandwagons develop and disappear with limited success in addressing problems. The public demands progress from all the sciences, and as time moves along and problems get worse, more rapid progress is demanded. The result for ecology has too often been poor, short-term science and poor management decisions. But since the science is rarely repeated and the management results may be a generation or two down the line, it is difficult for the public or for scientists to decide how good or bad the scientific advice has been. In ecology over the past 100 years we have made solid achievements in behavioural ecology, population dynamics, and ecological methods, we have made some progress in understanding community and ecosystem dynamics, but we have made less useful progress in developing theoretical ecology, landscape ecology, and natural resource management. The key to increasing progress is to adopt a systems approach with explicit hypotheses, theoretical models, and field experiments on a scale defined by the problem. With continuous feedback between problems, possible solutions, relevant theory and experimental data we can achieve our scientific goals.},

The seral stages studied were a 2- to 3-year-old field (the herbaceous field), a 30-year-old field (the cedar field), and a climax oak-hickory forest (the oak forest). Two study plots, each with an area of 2 hectares, were chosen within each seral stage. Diversity indices were calculated using the Shannon-Weaver information formula, H' - -pi log,, pi. The species count (species richness) was found to account for many of the differences in BSD between the seral stages. The evenness with which species were numerically distributed (equitability) was found to be lowest and to have its greatest influence on the diversity index in the herbaceous field, due to the presence of large flocks of non-nesting species. Equitability was higher and more constant in the cedar field and oak forest. Territoriality was thought to account for the higher equitabilities observed in summer. In winter, the more rigorous environment was thought to be a factor in lowering the equitability at least in the cedar field. Equitability was not lowered as much in the oak forest, possibly due to aggregations of birds into mixed species flocks. The cedar field and oak forest were quite different in their seasonal patterns of equitability. Both species richness and equitability were concluded to be important parameters in ecological study.},

The association of fish farms with disease emergence in sympatric wild fish stocks remains one of the most controversial and unresolved threats aquaculture poses to coastal ecosystems and fisheries. We report a comprehensive analysis of the spread and impact of farm-origin parasites on the survival of wild fish populations. We mathematically coupled extensive data sets of native parasitic sea lice (               Lepeophtheirus salmonis               ) transmission and pathogenicity on migratory wild juvenile pink (               Oncorhynchus gorbuscha               ) and chum (               Oncorhynchus keta               ) salmon. Farm-origin lice induced 9\textendash 95\% mortality in several sympatric wild juvenile pink and chum salmon populations. The epizootics arise through a mechanism that is new to our understanding of emerging infectious diseases: fish farms undermine a functional role of host migration in protecting juvenile hosts from parasites associated with adult hosts. Although the migratory life cycles of Pacific salmon naturally separate adults from juveniles, fish farms provide               L. salmonis               novel access to juvenile hosts, in this case raising infection rates for at least the first {$\approx$}2.5 months of the salmon's marine life ({$\approx$}80 km of the migration route). Spatial segregation between juveniles and adults is common among temperate marine fishes, and as aquaculture continues its rapid growth, this disease mechanism may challenge the sustainability of coastal ecosystems and economies.},

Comparisons of topographical maps between 1993 and 2011 reveals declines in total cover of intertidal coral reef flats (from 17.0 km2 to 9.5 km2) and sand/mudflats has (from 8.0 km2 to 5.0 km2), largely because of extensive land reclamation. Conversely, mangrove forests have increased (from 4.8 km2 to 6.4 km2) due to restoration efforts and greater regulatory protection. However, 15 and 50-year projections based on Singapore's 2008 Master Plan and 2011 Concept Plan show that all habitats are predicted to shrink further as new reclamations are completed. Such decline may be counteracted, at least in part, if ecological engineering is used to help conserve biodiversity. The problems exemplified by Singapore, and the potential future solutions discussed in our paper, provide guidance for urban marine conservation in coastal cities that are experiencing rapid development and land use change.},

Only one impact lake showed significant changes in percent organic matter. Significant changes (p {$<$} 0.05) in species composition following forest harvesting were detected in all four impact lakes and in one of the four reference lakes. However, the changes in diatom species composition following clear-cutting in the impact lakes were small, with changes in the relative abundance of the most common species being maximally 20\%, but more typically 3\textendash 10\%.},

We exhaustively seined six shallow-water sites (including semi-permanent barrier island ponds, permanent mainland marsh ponds, tidal pools, and tidal rivulets) and compared these collection data to those obtained with minnow traps. The relative frequency of occurrence of fish species was significantly different between the two methods in all cases. Further comparison of the two techniques at ten additional sites representing a wide variety of habitat types and sizes suggested similar biases inherent to minnow traps. Specifically, minnow traps bias toward collection of a common marsh resident, the mummichog Fundulus heteroclitus, and bias against collection of several other resident species and juveniles of estuarine transient species. Minnow traps can be an effective collection technique for certain nekton species; however, specific biases inherent to the technique preclude their use as a method to accurately describe fish assemblages in shallow-water estuarine habitats.},

Yet stable isotopes have not been applied to quantitatively characterize community-wide aspects of trophic structure (i.e., at the level of an entire food web). We propose quantitative metrics that can be used to this end, drawing on similar approaches from ecomorphology research. For example, the convex hull area occupied by species in d13C\textendash d15N niche space is a representation of the total extent of trophic diversity within a food web, whereas mean nearest neighbor distance among all species pairs is a measure of species packing within trophic niche space. To facilitate discussion of opportunities and limitations of the metrics, we provide empirical and conceptual examples drawn from Bahamian tidal creek food webs. These examples illustrate how this methodology can be used to quantify trophic diversity and trophic redundancy in food webs, as well as to link individual species to characteristics of the food web in which they are embedded. Building from extensive applications of stable isotope ratios by ecologists, the community-wide metrics may provide a new perspective on food web structure, function, and dynamics.},

I review recent research developments that pertain to each question, including a discussion of the limitations of stable isotope ratios in understanding the mangrove-fishes link. I emphasize promising avenues for future research, including labeled isotope tracer experiments, probabilistic and spatial analyses of potential basal resource pools, novel community-wide and intraspecific metrics, and utilization of differential tissue turnover rates within and among organisms. Stable isotope ratios alone provide numerous insights into the role of mangroves as fish habitat, but the most thorough understanding of the mangrove-fisheries link is likely to stem from integrative approaches that combine stable isotope ratio analyses and other methodologies into a broad research framework.},

We provide a comprehensive review of these techniques, and thus a single reference source to help identify the most useful approaches to apply to a given data set. We structure the review around four general questions: (1) what is the trophic position of an organism in a food web?; (2) which resource pools support consumers?; (3) what additional information does relative position of consumers in isotopic space reveal about food-web structure?; and (4) what is the degree of trophic variability at the intrapopulation level? For each general question, we detail different approaches that have been applied, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of each.

We detected a pattern of temporally increasing introgressive hybridization between the stocked population and both source populations. The proportion of fish returning to the river after a single winter at sea (               versus               several ones) was higher in fish assigned to the main source population than in local individuals. Moreover, during the first decade of the study, both single-sea-winter and multi-sea-winter (MSW) fish assigned to the main source population were smaller than local fish. During the second decade of the study, MSW fish defined as hybrids were lighter and smaller than fish from parental populations, suggesting outbreeding depression. Overall, this study suggests that supplementation with non-local individuals may alter not only the genetic diversity of wild populations but also life-history traits of adaptive significance.},

We analyzed how management-related environmental variables were reflected in the measure of: (i) species richness, (ii) number of conservation-relevant species (red-listed species and old-growth forest indicators) and (iii) functional diversity targeting five organism groups with different habitat requirements, i.e. vascular plants, epiphytic lichens and bryophytes, saproxylic fungi and breeding birds. Results: Plain species richness at stand level was generally misleading, as it did not capture changes in the number of conservation relevant species with changes in management-related environmental variables. The interpretation of functional responses was most informative for the better known vascular plants, while responses were more fragmented for the other organism groups. Overall, however, functional responses were consistent with a loss of specialization and progressive simplification of species assemblages from long-unmanaged to intensively managed stands. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the occurrence of conservation-relevant species is a sound and relevant metric for planning and evaluating conservation actions, especially for less studied organism groups (e.g., saproxylic fungi and epiphytes). The functional approach is promising, but presupposes the availability of databases of relevant traits.},

Advances in high-resolution remote sensing technologies, such as laser altimetry, acoustic sensors, and photogrammetry now provide the capability to map complex ecosystem structure in three dimensions, creating more structurally realistic models of the environment. In the present article, we focus on high-resolution 3D structure, using terrestrial and marine examples to illustrate how state-of-the-art advances in landscape ecology achieved through novel data fusion, spatial analysis, and geovisualization of environmental data can provide new ecological insights. These examples provide a look to the future in landscape and seascape ecology, where continued progress toward a multidimensional science will fundamentally shift the way we view, explore, and conceptualize the world.},

In contrast, definitive evidence of precontact plant management has been elusive. Documenting the nature and extent of precontact plant-management strategies has relevance to historians, archaeologists, managers, conservationists, forest ecologists, and First Nations. In this paper, we summarize the various lines of evidence that have been, or could be, used to document ancient cultivation in the northwest of North America. We organize this discussion by the ecological consequences of ancient plant-management practices and their documented or potential visibility in the paleo-, neo-ecological, and archaeological records. Our review demonstrates that while finding evidence of ancient plant management can be difficult, such evidence can be found when innovative research methods are applied. Further, when various independent lines of evidence are compiled, reconstructions of past plant-management strategies are strengthened considerably.

Such management practices ensured the ongoing productivity of valued resources and were embedded in a complex web of socio-economic interactions. Using ethnographic and archaeological data, this paper synthesizes the ecological and cultural aspects of marine management systems of coastal First Nations. We divide our discussion into four aspects of traditional management systems: harvesting methods, enhancement strategies, tenure systems, and worldview and social relations. The ethnographic data, including memories of living knowledge holders, tend to provide windows into daily actions and the more intangible aspects of management; the archaeological record provides insights into the more tangible aspects and how management systems developed through time and space. This review demonstrates not only the breadth of Northwest Coast marine management but also the value of integrating different kinds of knowledge and data to more fully document the whole of these ancient management systems.},

  abstract = {While there is increasing recognition among archaeologists of the extent to which non-agricultural societies have managed their terrestrial ecosystems, the traditional management of marine ecosystems has largely been ignored. In this paper, we bring together Indigenous ecological knowledge, coastal geomorphological observations, and archaeological data to document how Northwest Coast First Nations cultivated clams to maintain and increase productivity. We focus on ``clam gardens,'' walled intertidal terraces constructed to increase bivalve habitat and productivity. Our survey and excavations of clam gardens in four locations in British Columbia provide insights into the ecological and social context, morphology, construction, and first reported ages of these features. These data demonstrate the extent of traditional maricultural systems among coastal First Nations and, coupled with previously collected information on terrestrial management, challenge us to broaden our definition of ``forager'' as applied to Northwest Coast peoples. This study also highlights the value of combining diverse kinds of knowledge, including archaeological data, to understand the social and ecological contexts of traditional management systems.           ,              R\'esum\'e             Si bien se observa, a partir de la arqueolog\'ia, un mayor reconocimiento sobre la medida de incursi\'on de las sociedad no-agr\'icolas en el manejo sus ecosistemas terrestres, el manejo tradicional de los ecosistemas marinos ha sido considerablemente ignorado.

  abstract = {Clam gardens are ancient mariculture features developed by Indigenous Peoples of the Northwest Coast of North America that create shallow sloping intertidal shelves where clam productivity is enhanced. We quantify the area of clam habitat created by constructing rock-walled clam gardens terraces in northern Quadra Island, British Columbia, Canada. We combined modelling, highresolution mapping, beach sampling, and a comprehensive survey of the shoreline to document the location and areal extent of clam habitat in clam gardens today. We divided our analysis into three classes of clam gardens, which differ in substrate and thus the amount of clam habitat created. We found that Indigenous People built clam garden walls on 35\% of the shoreline and that about 112,979 m2 of flat beach terrace were created by clam garden construction. Collectively, the three classes of clam gardens increased clam habitat area between 26 and 36\%. About 35\% of the area of clam habitat in clam gardens was constructed de novo on bedrock shelves and rocky slopes where no clam habitat existed previously. Furthermore, about 12.0\% of clam gardens are smaller than 30 m2, reflecting the effort put into creating enhanced food production wherever possible. Our analysis demonstrates that clam management in the form of clam gardens was extensive prior to colonization and that these features still have a significant impact on today's intertidal ecosystems. Clam habitat expansion facilitated by clam garden construction encouraged a sustainable and abundant food source in the past and could do so again in today's changing environmental conditions.},

As the rarity and upstanding curative effects of natural Cordyceps, several mycelial strains have been isolated from natural Cordyceps and manufactured in large quantities by fermentation technology, and they are commonly sold as health food products in Asia. In addition, some substitutes such as Cordyceps militaris also have been used and adulterants also confused the market.

  abstract = {Determining the importance of prey taxa in the diets of predacious species is a frequent objective in fisheries research. Various indices of prey importance are in common use, and all give different results because of their emphasis on different aspects of fish diets. We explored these differences by empirically comparing four well-known indices\textemdash percent weight (\%W), percent occurrence (\%O), percent number (\%N), and percent index of relative importance (\%IRI)\textemdash as well as a modified \%IRI (\%MIRI), as applied to an extensive data set on the diets of six fish species in Spirit Lake, Iowa. Correlations among all indices were positive but were weaker among component indices (\%W, \%O, and \%N) than between the two compound indices (\%IRI and \%MIRI); correlations among component indices were also weaker than correlations of compound with component indices. Correlation strength of \%MIRI with the three component indices varied greatly (\%N Ͻ \%O Ͻ \%W), whereas the correlation strength of \%IRI with component indices was similar. Importance values based on \%W, \%MIRI, and \%N depend more on prey size than those based on \%IRI and \%O. The \%W and \%MIRI emphasized the importance of large prey taxa, whereas \%N emphasized small prey in diets; \%IRI and \%O were similarly unbiased with respect to prey size. The \%O yielded substantially higher importance values than all other indices. Thus, for use as a general index of dietary importance, we believe \%IRI provides the optimal balancing of frequency of occurrence, numerical abundance, and abundance by weight of taxa in fish diets.},

Analytical methods for identifying the most commonly used aluminium compounds, such as boehmite and aluminium hydroxyphosphate, are mentioned. Emphasis is placed on the important factors for antigen adsorption and on the latest work using gene-deficient mice in the research of the mechanism of aluminium adjuvants in terms of cytokine and T-cell subset stimulation. Key references on the ability of aluminium adjuvants to stimulate IgE and also in vivo clearing of aluminium adjuvants are discussed. Furthermore, the review addresses the issue of local reactions in the context of injection route and local tissue disturbance. Possible new applications of aluminium adjuvants in, for example, combined aluminium-adsorbed protein and DNA oligonucleotide vaccines as well as the possible use of aluminium adjuvants in combination with IL-12 to stimulate Th1-type immune responses are mentioned.},

  abstract = {Species richness is an important characteristic of ecological communities, but it is difficult to quantify. We report here a thorough inventory of a tropical rain forest ant fauna and use it to evaluate species richness estimators. The study was carried out in - 1500 ha of lowland rain forest at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. Diverse methods were used, including canopy fogging, Malaise traps, Berlese samples, Winkler samples, baiting, and manual search. Workers of 437 ant species were encountered. The abundance distribution was clearly lognormal, and the distribution emerged from a veil line with each doubling of sampling effort. Three richness estimates were calculated: the area under the fitted lognormal distribution, the asymptote of the Michaelis-Menten equation fit to the species accumulation curve, and the Incidence-based Coverage Estimator (ICE). The performance of the estimators was evaluated with sample-based rarefaction plots. The inventory was nearly complete because the species accumulation curve approached an asymptote, the richness estimates were very close to the observed species richness, and the uniques and duplicates curves were both declining. None of the richness estimators was stable in samplebased rarefaction plots, but regions of stability of estimators occurred. The explanation of rarity is one key to understanding why richness estimates fail. Fifty-one species (12\% of the total) were still uniques (known from only one sample) at the end of the inventory. The rarity of 20 of these species was explained by "edge effects": "methodological edge species" (possibly abundant at the site but difficult to sample because of their microhabitat), and "geographic edge species," known to be common in habitats or regions outside of La Selva. Rarity of 31 species remained unexplained. Most of the 51 rare species were known from additional collections outside of La Selva, either in other parts of Costa Rica or in other countries. Only six species were "global uniques," known to date from only one sample on Earth. The study demonstrates that patterns of species occurrence early in an inventory may be inadequate to estimate species richness, but that relatively complete inventories of species-rich arthropod communities are possible if multiple sampling methods and extensive effort are applied.},

The study was carried out by a series of line transects run underwater with SCUBA apparatus from the reef fiat to a depth of 30 m. The reefs of Eilat are of the fringing type, with scleractinian corals as the most important hermatypic organisms. The different zones of the reef are analyzed on the basis of topographical characteristics of the reef, as well as from the numerical data on abundance and living coverage, using cluster analysis of all transects surveyed. The present knowledge concerning species diversity is reviewed and analyzed in the context of hermatypic coral data. Three different diversity indices (the species count, S \textasciitilde{} s o N ' s index and S\textasciitilde mo\textasciitilde r and W\textasciitilde Av\textasciitilde 's index) were calculated for estimating the diversity obtained on different zones of the reef. It was found that there is a successive increase in diversity of hermatypie corals from shallow water to a depth of 30 m. Species diversity and living coverage of corals were significantly greater in steeper zones as compared to flatter zones of the reef. A possible explanation for this phenomenon is the accumulation of sediments in the flat zones. It is proposed that the severe and unpredictable nature ofthe reef flat may account for low abundance and living coverage of corms. It is also proposed that deep-water species which do not invade shallow water are species which have developed high specialization to their local environment. The idea that light intensityis a significant factor in calcium-carbonate deposition by seleractinian corals is supported by field measurements of individual colonies at different depths.},

  abstract = {Size distributions of biotic assemblages are important modifiers of productivity and function in marine sediments. We investigated the distribution of proportional organic biomass among logarithmic size classes (226J to 216J) in the softbottom macrofaunal communities of the Strait of Georgia, Salish Sea on the west coast of Canada. The study examines how size structure is influenced by 3 fundamental habitat descriptors: depth, sediment percent fines, and organic flux (modified by quality). These habitat variables are uncorrelated in this hydrographically diverse area, thus we examine their effects in combination and separately. Cluster analyses and cumulative biomass size spectra reveal clear and significant responses to each separate habitat variable. When combined, habitat factors result in three distinct assemblages: (1) communities with a high proportion of biomass in small organisms, typical of shallow areas (,10 m) with coarse sediments (,10\% fines) and low accumulation of organic material (,3.0 gC/m2/yr/d15N); (2) communities with high proportion of biomass in the largest organisms found in the Strait, typical of deep, fine sediments with high modified organic flux (.3 g C/m2/yr/d15N) from the Fraser River; and (3) communities with biomass dominated by moderately large organisms, but lacking the smallest and largest size classes, typical of deep, fine sediments experiencing low modified organic flux (,3.0 gC/m2/yr/d15N). The remaining assemblages had intermediate habitat types and size structures. Sediment percent fines and flux appear to elicit threshold responses in size structure, whereas depth has the most linear influence on community size structure. The ecological implications of size structure in the Strait of Georgia relative to environmental conditions, secondary production and sediment bioturbation are discussed.},

The growing numbers of constructions and other physical and structural alterations of the shoreline often take place in nursery and spawning habitats of many fish and other aquatic species. Several coastal fish populations have seen marked declines in abundance and diversity during the past two decades. A systematic review on the topic would clarify if anthropogenic physical and structural changes of near-shore areas have effects on fish recruitment and which these effects are. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} The review will examine how various physical and structural anthropogenic changes of nearshore fish habitats affect fish recruitment. Relevant studies include small- and large-scale field studies in marine and brackish systems or large lakes in temperate regions of the Northern and Southern hemispheres. Relevant studies may be based on comparisons between undisturbed and disturbed areas, before and after disturbance, or both. Relevant outcomes include measures of recruitment defined as abundance of juveniles of nearshore fish communities. Searches will be made for peer-reviewed and grey literature in English, Dutch, Danish, Finnish, German, Swedish and Spanish. All fish species and species groups will be considered in this review. Included relevant studies will be subject to a critical appraisal that will assess study validity. From relevant included studies, we will extract information on study characteristics, measured outcomes, exposure, comparators, effect modifiers and critical appraisal.

I'm speaking specifically about declining mental health, and for this short essay I focus on our most emergent of theatre and performance-studies scholars: our graduate students. Few of us would disagree that there has always been a significant amount of depression and anxiety among our masters and doctoral students. Recent studies, however, find that more grad students are reporting significant mental health issues today than in any past generation. Perhaps these higher numbers are simply a matter of different and better diagnosing. More likely, those entering graduate programs today have more stressors outside academia: family responsibilities, financial concerns, and culture-related anxiety (more minorities and other historically disenfranchised groups and international students are entering graduate programs than ever before). Moreover, the increase in treatments in the past decades has enabled more students with a history of mental health issues to make it to higher education. It's not the purpose of this short piece to suss out the kinds of student in our programs more likely to be mentally and emotionally distressed. Instead, I look at what we should be doing not to make it worse for the students we have in the years ahead, actions that will benefit the field as a whole and all of us individually.},

The purpose of this research is to evaluate the development and relative habitat value of man-made oyster habitat by monitoring oyster growth and the colonization by structurally important and resident oyster reef community species. Sixteen sampling units of commercial spat sticks in densities of 81/m2 were deployed prior to the oyster reproductive season during April 2004. Two sampling units were extracted every 3 mo starting July 2004 and assessed for biomass; oyster shell height and growth rate; oyster, barnacle, and mussel density per 0.01 m2; and species and phyla richness. Maximum oyster growth rate (0.39 mm/day) occurred during January 2005, with mean oyster shell height peaking at 83.56 {$\pm$} 1.31 mm by May 2005. Oysters, barnacles, and scorched mussels appeared concurrently on sampling units during July 2004, and ribbed mussels appeared in October 2004. There were significant positive relationships between oyster and mussel (ribbed and scorched) densities (P {$<$} 0.0001), but none were detected between oyster and barnacle densities. Reef species rapidly colonized sampling units (24 of 31 species by October 2004), and a significant correlation between biomass and species (R2 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.91) and phyla (R2 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.96) richness was observed. Settlement and optimal growth of structurally important species on vertically elevated man-made oyster reef enhanced habitat availability and supported rapid colonization of reef-associated species.},

  abstract = {The impact of mining activities on spider (Araneae) diversity and assemblages was studied in two abandoned mine sites in Sardinia (Italy), where mining activities started in the middle of the nineteenth century and closed down over a century later. Spider community composition was analysed in dumps, undisturbed forests and scrublands which represent the natural chronosequence following the abandonment of the mining district. The identification of spiders was performed at the lowest taxonomic level possible and differences in abundance, species richness (SR), and functional diversity (FD) were analysed. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and a permutated multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) routine were conducted to evaluate the relationships of spider assemblages with land cover, and the indicator species analysis was performed to identify the typifying species. During the entire sampling period, 2312 spiders were captured, and approximately 80\% of the total were identified at the species level (79 spider species belonging to 28 different families). No differences in abundance and SR were found, whereas FD, which showed the highest values in forests, significantly differed among sites. A distinct separation among assemblages and a significant effect of the land use on spider assemblages were found (PERMANOVA, R2 = 0.59, p {$<$} 0.001). Twelve species were selected as indicator species. Our results underlined the possibility to consider grounddwelling spiders as a valuable target group for biomonitoring programmes supporting projects of near-natural restoration and/ or technical reclamation of mining sites.},

Nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were manipulated using nutrient-diffusing clay substrates; light levels were manipulated with shade cloth. Periphyton biovolume and cell densities increased significantly with both nitrogen and phosphorus enrichment but were not affected by shading. Phosphorus enrichment increased periphyton accumulation only when nitrogen levels were high, indicating a significant interactive effect between nitrogen and phosphorus. Differences in species composition among treatments were mostly due to changes in the diatoms Nitzschia palea and Rhopalodia gibba. Ambient and phosphorus-enriched substrates were dominated by R. gibba, which contains a nitrogen-fixing endosymbiont, and blue-green algae. Nitrogen enrichment and nitrogen and phosphorus in combination resulted in an assemblage dominated by N. palea. Unshaded and highly shaded substrates were dominated by N. palea and Achnanthes minutissima, but the medium-shade substrates were dominated by R. gibba.},

The results show that some `southern' species including Osilinus lineatus da Costa and Gibbula umbilicalis da Costa have undergone north and north-eastern range extensions. Populations have increased in abundance and adult size has decreased since the previous surveys were conducted. These changes have been synchronous throughout Britain, strongly suggesting that climate is responsible. The use of intertidal species as indicators of climate change is proposed.},

We used fish community data ({$>$}200 species) from extensive surveys conducted in two biogeographic provinces (extent {$>$}1,000 km) in North America to quantify the relationship between fish species richness and local (grain {$<$}10 km2) environmental heterogeneity. Our analyses are based on samples collected at nearly 800 stations over a period of five years. We demonstrate that fish species richness in coastal ecosystems is associated locally with the spatial heterogeneity of environmental variables but not with their magnitude. The observed effect of heterogeneity on species richness was substantially greater than that generated by simulations from a random placement model of community assembly, indicating that the observed relationship is unlikely to arise from veil or sampling effects. Our results suggest that restoring or actively protecting areas of high habitat heterogeneity may be of great importance for slowing current trends of decreasing biodiversity in coastal ecosystems.},

We discuss the "soft-law" context of declarations, regional agreements, ethical guidelines, research protocols, and policy frameworks, which reinforce indigenous entitlements. The elaboration of these rights will increasingly impinge upon scientific research by regulating access to the knowledge and resources of indigenous and local communities, and by requiring that policy and management be made with their full participation. Scientists should respond by following these developments, institutionalizing this participation at all levels of scientific activity, and respecting the value of indigenous knowledge.},

The model is age-structured, stochastic and spatially distributed on a 20 3 20 grid. The major processes modelled are episodic settlement, juvenile avoidance of adults, and density-dependent predation by eagle rays. These processes have spatially homogenising effects, emphasising that the within-site biological processes do not seem to account for large-scale spatial patterns in the density of adult Macomona. When considering the role of local biotic interactions in generating large-scale patterns, the specifics of the biological processes are important. In particular, species whose recruitment is localised in or close to existing patches, and where mortality is concentrated on the periphery of the patches will be more likely to show persistent intrinsically generated spatial patterns. \textcopyright{} 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

A method of quantifying surface topography in the field using a profile gauge is introduced and found to be rapid and to generate concise summary statistics. Of the 6 measures of substratum topography compared, 1was novel, 2 were derivations of geomorphological techniques and 3 had been previously used in reef fish studies. Measures included the sum of consecutive substratum height differences, vector standard deviation (SD),substratum angle SD, substratum height SD, substratum height coefficient of variation (CV) and the ratio of contoured surface distance to linear distance ('chain-and-tape'). All but the CV were found to grossly differentiate among surfaces that varied in corrugation height and frequency. Consecutive substratum height difference, substratum angle SD and vector SD were best able to differentiate between 9 schematic profiles of varying topography. A field test of the methods was carried out on 100 quadrats (3 X 3 m) from the backreef of Lizard Island, northern Great Barrier Reef, Australia, in which the surface topography, fish and benthic communities had been sampled. The consecutive height difference method performed consistently well, scoring the highest average correlations with total fish abundance, diversity and the abundance of individual species. In an examination of the relationship between the backreef fish assemblage, substratum topography and the cover of benthic organisms, topography was only secondary in importance to depth in describing the patterns of damselfish abundance at the scale sampled.},

  abstract = {In Washington state, commercial culture of geoducks (Panopea generosa) involves large-scale out-planting of juveniles to intertidal habitats, and installation of PVC tubes and netting to exclude predators and increase early survival. Structures associated with this nascent aquaculture method are examined to determine whether they affect patterns of use by resident and transient macrofauna. Results are summarized from regular surveys of aquaculture operations and reference beaches in 2009 to 2011 at three sites during three phases of culture: (1) pregear (\textendash geoducks, \textendash structure), (2) gear present (+geoducks, +structures), and (3) postgear (+geoducks, \textendash structures). Resident macroinvertebrates (infauna and epifauna) were sampled monthly (in most cases) using coring methods at low tide during all three phases. Differences in community composition between culture plots and reference areas were examined with permutational analysis of variance and homogeneity of multivariate dispersion tests. Scuba and shoreline transect surveys were used to examine habitat use by transient fish and macroinvertebrates. Analysis of similarity and complementary nonmetric multidimensional scaling were used to compare differences between species functional groups and habitat type during different aquaculture phases. Results suggest that resident and transient macrofauna respond differently to structures associated with geoduck aquaculture. No consistent differences in the community of resident macrofauna were observed at culture plots or reference areas at the three sites during any year. Conversely, total abundance of transient fish and macroinvertebrates were more than two times greater at culture plots than reference areas when aquaculture structures were in place. Community composition differed (analysis of similarity) between culture and reference plots during the gear-present phase, but did not persist to the next farming stage (postgear). Habitat complexity associated with shellfish aquaculture may attract some structure-associated transient species observed infrequently on reference beaches, and may displace other species that typically occur in areas lacking epibenthic structure. This study provides a first look at the effects of multiple phases of geoduck farming on macrofauna, and has important implications for the management of a rapidly expanding sector of the aquaculture industry.},

The practice Western science calls ``clam gardens'' has played a significant role in First Nations communities of the Pacific Northwest for perhaps millennia. However, the gardens have not been tended for decades and restoration is now required. To achieve restoration, governance must focus on improving traditional and scientific knowledge of the gardens and on balancing inequalities that contributed to the depressed health of clam gardens. Leveraging a five-year clam garden restoration effort lead by Parks Canada and the WS\'ANE\'C and Hul'qumi'num First Nations of British Columbia, this research explores these challenges through interviews with First Nations, researchers, and representatives from Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve, Tla-o-qui-aht Tribal Parks, and Pacific Rim National Park Reserve. Results point to considerations for the development of clam garden governance models now and into the future.},

  abstract = {Zooarchaeological data provide direct evidence of long-term human resource utilization relevant to the modern study of sustainability and conservation. On the northwest coast of North America, prehistoric aboriginal communities relied heavily on nearshore marine fish species, many of which have life history characteristics that make them vulnerable to overexploitation. This study examines temporal trends in the abundance and distribution of nearshore fish from skeletal remains recovered from three separate areas of a prehistoric coastal village on the west coast of Vancouver Island (ca. 1800\textendash 250 yr BP). Over the course of 1500 years, site inhabitants from these contemporaneously occupied areas regularly utilized Sebastes spp. (rockfish), with varying impacts on abundance and total length. Contrasting temporal trends in Sebastes spp. total length in separate village areas suggest different consequences to prehistoric harvesting practices, differences that can be linked to ethnographic and archaeological evidence of lineage-based territories. These long-term zooarchaeological data provide unique insights into the context and challenges of sustainable resource use in prehistory and can inform contemporary conservation efforts focused on similar species in this modern-day marine protected area.},

  abstract = {Significance             Over the last century, Pacific herring, a forage fish of tremendous cultural, economic, and ecological importance, has declined in abundance over much of its range. We synthesize archaeological fisheries data spanning the past 10,000 y from Puget Sound in Washington to southeast Alaska to extend the ecological baseline for herring and contextualize the dynamics of modern industrial fisheries. While modern herring populations can be erratic and exhibit catastrophic declines, the archaeological record indicates a pattern of consistent abundance, providing an example of long-term sustainability and resilience in a fishery known for its modern variability. The most parsimonious explanation for the discrepancy between herring abundance in the ancient and more recent past is industrial harvesting over the last century.           ,                             Pacific herring (               Clupea pallasii               ), a foundation of coastal social-ecological systems, is in decline throughout much of its range. We assembled data on fish bones from 171 archaeological sites from Alaska, British Columbia, and Washington to provide proxy measures of past herring distribution and abundance. The dataset represents 435,777 fish bones, dating throughout the Holocene, but primarily to the last 2,500 y. Herring is the single-most ubiquitous fish taxon (99\% ubiquity) and among the two most abundant taxa in 80\% of individual assemblages. Herring bones are archaeologically abundant in all regions, but are superabundant in the northern Salish Sea and southwestern Vancouver Island areas. Analyses of temporal variability in 50 well-sampled sites reveals that herring exhibits consistently high abundance ({$>$}20\% of fish bones) and consistently low variance ({$<$}10\%) within the majority of sites (88\% and 96\%, respectively). We pose three alternative hypotheses to account for the disjunction between modern and archaeological herring populations. We reject the first hypothesis that the archaeological data overestimate past abundance and underestimate past variability. We are unable to distinguish between the second two hypotheses, which both assert that the archaeological data reflect a higher mean abundance of herring in the past, but differ in whether variability was similar to or less than that observed recently. In either case, sufficient herring was consistently available to meet the needs of harvesters, even if variability is damped in the archaeological record. These results provide baseline information prior to herring depletion and can inform modern management.},

  abstract = {Fisheries are of fundamental importance to Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest of North America today and in the past but few archaeological analyses have documented geographic patterning in fisheries across the entire region. This paper adopts meta-analysis methods and GIS-based spatial visualizations to survey the single largest compilation of fine-screened zooarchaeological fisheries data reported to date, including 513,605 fish remains identified at 222 sites from Oregon to southeast Alaska. These systematically collected zooarchaeological data indicate the most ubiquitous and proportionally abundant fish taxa over the late Holocene and reveal previously undocumented spatial patterning, indicating where certain fish taxa are consistently found in high relative proportions. Rather than seeking to evaluate chronological and/or evolutionary change, this study explores the environmental and cultural basis for assessing variability in Indigenous fisheries over millennial time scales. Specifically, we observe Pacific herring and the Pacific salmons to be the two most ubiquitous and proportionally abundant fish taxa across the Northwest Coast followed by flatfishes, sculpins, rockfishes, greenlings, dogfish, and a host of other poorly known taxa that represent consistent fishing effort. We document geographic patterning in the abundance and ubiquity of a range of fish including greater abundance of salmons in northern portions of the study area and outline trends that could represent biogeographic ranges for northern anchovy, Pacific hake, and pollock, among others. We conclude that examining patterning in the ubiquity and rank-order abundance represented by archaeological fisheries data offers significant potential for linking regionally distinct cultural practices noted in the 18th and 19th centuries to much longer human and ecological histories over the Holocene.},

  abstract = {Bottom trawling alters the abundance, diversity, size-composition, and function of benthic communities. However, the ability to detect these impacts over large spatial scales can be obscured by various complicating factors, such as community adaptation to disturbance and co-varying environmental conditions. An ecosystembased approach to fisheries management therefore requires ecological indicators which can `disentangle' trawling effects from other natural and human drivers, and respond effectively to shifts in ecological quality. We collected benthic macrofaunal samples at 21 sites across a Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus fishing ground in the Kattegat, and separated the benthic community into small (1\textendash 4 mm) and large ({$>$}4 mm) size fractions. Four taxonomic indicators (total density, species density, Shannon diversity, and biomass) and four functional indicators (functional diversity, functional richness, functional evenness, and functional dispersion) were calculated based on each size fraction, and the two fractions combined (pooled community). Here, we compare the ability of these indicators to detect trawling impacts across size categories. We show that indicators derived from large macrofauna were highly effective in this regard, and were less influenced by other environmental drivers, such as depth, sediment grain size, bottom current velocity, salinity, and temperature. This suggests that the taxonomic and functional characteristics of benthic communities display a size-dependent sensitivity to trawling disturbance, and therefore community metrics based on large benthic macrofauna may provide useful indicators. By contrast, indicators derived from the small fraction performed poorly, and those based on the pooled community demonstrated a varied ability to detect trawling. Small macrofauna are typically characterised by high density, diversity, and population growth rates, and their relative resilience to trawling may mask the response of the more sensitive macrofauna. This highlights an underlying issue with calculating indicators based on the whole benthic community. The approach outline here is easily applied, improves indicator performance, and has the potential to reduce laboratory workloads due to the fewer taxa and individuals required for analyses.},

Scholarship over the past four decades has documented plant and animal food resource enhancement by Aboriginal Australians that blur socioeconomic boundaries with agricultural societies of New Guinea. Enhancements were achieved by using intimate knowledge of local ecological processes to modify ecosystems through a range of strategies such as landscape burning, animal translocation, protected rearing, shelter creation, and restocking. These strategies were embedded within broader sociocultural and sociopolitical domains that were often accompanied by ritual. Such engineered food enhancement practices reveal that many documented and modelled associations between environment and behaviour are in fact correlations between behaviour and the products of behaviour. The uneven distribution of animal resource enhancement practices across Australia indicates considerable regional diversity and supports existing views that many enhancements are related to regionally specific and historically contingent developments in social complexity.},

  abstract = {In recent decades, the abundance of sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka in the Nimpkish River watershed (Vancouver Island) has declined by more than 80\%. To improve sockeye salmon abundance, one of three Nimpkish nursery lakes (Woss Lake, 13.6 km2) was fertilized; a second (Vernon Lake, 8.4 km2) was maintained as an unmanipulated reference. For 3 years (2000\textendash 2002), we assessed changes in phytoplankton, zooplankton, and juvenile sockeye salmon and then used food web analysis to model the fate of fertilizer phosphorus (FP) as it moved up the food web to juvenile sockeye salmon. As the experiment progressed, we found two distinctly different results. During the first 2 years (2000 and 2001), fertilization was associated with higher concentrations of P, chlorophyll, and phytoplankton. However, because most of the algae were inedible diatoms (principally Rhizosolenia eriensis), only 8\% of the algal standing stock was available to zooplankton and less than 0.1\% of the FP was incorporated into sockeye salmon biomass via limnetic pathways. The result was that juvenile sockeye salmon growth rates in the treated and control lakes were not significantly different. During the third year (2002), a bloom of the diatom Leptocylindrus increased Woss Lake edible algal biomass by a factor of 7; zooplankton production tripled, and juvenile sockeye salmon production increased by 19\%. Consequently, Woss Lake juvenile sockeye salmon grew twice as fast as they did in untreated Vernon Lake, and juvenile sockeye salmon fall weights were 50\% higher than those recorded before the lake was fertilized. We conclude that for north Pacific coastal lakes, bottom-up effects resulting from changes in phytoplankton species composition can profoundly alter rates of juvenile sockeye salmon production. Regulation of algal species composition through manipulations of fertilizer composition and application timing might be used to reduce blooms of nuisance algae and increase age-0 sockeye salmon yield.},

However, rivers of mountain ecoregions are currently experiencing heightened levels of disturbance due to the introduction of nonnative species impacting endemic fishes in these areas. We compared the fish assemblages and diets of mountain steppe fishes of the stocked rivers in Wyoming with rivers in northern Mongolia where stocking is absent. Using gut content analysis, we quantified the selectivity and diets of fishes collected in these systems. Nonnative species had more generalist diets with lower levels of selectivity than most native species and native species had high levels of dietary specificity and selectivity. High abundances of nonnative species and high levels of dietary overlaps in our Wyoming sites is a cause of concern for native Cutthroat Trout and overall system stability. In contrast, fish assemblages characterizing Mongolia mountain steppe rivers were composed of only native species with diverse diets and higher selectivity values, suggesting low probability for interspecific competition.},

Cod isotope values were consistent with those of demersal organisms from near shore habitats (-12.5 {$\pm$} 0.9\textperthousand{} {$\delta$}13C, 16.1 {$\pm$} 1.4\textperthousand{} {$\delta$}15N), while salmon values were consistent with those of organisms existing in an open ocean habitat and at a lower trophic level (-15.2 {$\pm$} 1.4\textperthousand{} {$\delta$}13C, 11.5 {$\pm$} 1.7\textperthousand{} {$\delta$}15N). When comparing six different prehistoric time periods, two time periods had significantly different {$\delta$}13C for salmon. Otters had significantly different {$\delta$}15N values in two out of the six prehistoric time periods but no differences in {$\delta$}13C. The mean {$\delta$}13C, corrected for the oceanic Suess Effect, of modern specimens of all species (except Northern fur seals) were significantly lower than prehistoric animals. Several hypotheses are explored to explain these differences including a reduction in productivity during the twentieth century in this region of the Gulf of Alaska. If true, this suggests that North Pacific climate regimes experienced during the twentieth century may not be good analogs of North Pacific marine ecosystems during the late Holocene.},

In many areas, this water use is unsustainable; water supplies are also under pressure from other users and are being affected by climate change. Much effort is being made to reduce water use by crops and produce `more crop per drop'. This paper examines water use by crops, taking particularly a physiological viewpoint, examining the underlying relationships between carbon uptake, growth and water loss. Key examples of recent progress in both assessing and improving crop water productivity are described. It is clear that improvements in both agronomic and physiological understanding have led to recent increases in water productivity in some crops. We believe that there is substantial potential for further improvements owing to the progress in understanding the physiological responses of plants to water supply, and there is considerable promise within the latest molecular genetic approaches, if linked to the appropriate environmental physiology. We conclude that the interactions between plant and environment require a team approach looking across the disciplines from genes to plants to crops in their particular environments to deliver improved water productivity and contribute to sustainability.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Hatchery programmes involving the mass release of cultured fish have been implemented worldwide to supplement wild populations and to increase harvests. Hokkaido Island is one of the most active regions for Pacific salmon hatchery programmes, with ca. 1.2 billion (109) juveniles released annually along a coastline of ca. 3000 km. During the last quarter of the 20th century, coastal catches of chum and pink salmon increased dramatically, whereas those of masu salmon did not. In addition to the development of hatchery technologies, several possible hypotheses may explain these catch trends, including climate change, closing of high-seas fisheries, rehabilitation of water quality, habitat loss caused by damming and channelling, and increased pressure from recreational fisheries. Even when these other factors have been accounted for, it is difficult to evaluate whether all hatchery programmes have actually increased net populations. To use these programmes more effectively, it is necessary to evaluate both their river- and species-specific benefits and compare hatchery programmes with other management tools, such as fishery controls and habitat rehabilitation. Future hatchery programmes should incorporate active, adaptive learning approaches to minimize the risks associated with artificial propagation and to promote sustainable salmon stocks.},

  abstract = {Biodiversity, a multidimensional property of natural systems, is difficult to quantify partly because of the multitude of indices proposed for this purpose. Indices aim to describe general properties of communities that allow us to compare different regions, taxa, and trophic levels. Therefore, they are of fundamental importance for environmental monitoring and conservation, although there is no consensus about which indices are more appropriate and informative. We tested several common diversity indices in a range of simple to complex statistical analyses in order to determine whether some were better suited for certain analyses than others. We used data collected around the focal plant Plantago lanceolata on 60 temperate grassland plots embedded in an agricultural landscape to explore relationships between the common diversity indices of species richness (S), Shannon's diversity (H'), Simpson's diversity (D1), Simpson's dominance (D2), Simpson's evenness (E), and Berger\textendash Parker dominance (BP). We calculated each of these indices for herbaceous plants, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, aboveground arthropods, belowground insect larvae, and P. lanceolata molecular and chemical diversity. Including these trait-based measures of diversity allowed us to test whether or not they behaved similarly to the better studied species diversity. We used path analysis to determine whether compound indices detected more relationships between diversities of different organisms and traits than more basic indices. In the path models, more paths were significant when using H', even though all models except that with E were equally reliable. This demonstrates that while common diversity indices may appear interchangeable in simple analyses, when considering complex interactions, the choice of index can profoundly alter the interpretation of results. Data mining in order to identify the index producing the most significant results should be avoided, but simultaneously considering analyses using multiple indices can provide greater insight into the interactions in a system.},

  abstract = {Long-term use of herring by Alaska Natives is not well-documented over space or through time, yet this information can illuminate pre-industrial patterns of herring abundance and distribution. Such information is important to understand the sustained relationships Alaska Native fishers and egg collectors have had with herring. Understanding the genetics of pre-industrial herring may also inform management of the fish and fisheries to insure their survival into the future. In this paper, we attempt a contextualized account of the longterm history of Alaska Native herring fisheries, bringing together archaeological, ethnographic, and ethnohistorical data. We tie these together as background for presenting the preliminary results of the NSF-funded project, The Archaeology of Herring: Reconstructing the Past to Redeem the Future (No. 1203868). We have now tested 84 herring bone samples from 17 archaeological sites in Alaska expanding beyond Speller et al. (2012), having tripled the earlier archaeological dataset. The oldest herring bones identified archaeologically in Alaska are dated to more than 10,000 cal BP. Early Holocene and Middle Holocene sites have also yielded herring bones, although most of the record dates to the last 2400 years. Preservation of genetic information is effectively complete for the last 2400 years, but achievable back to the terminal Pleistocene (68\% success rate for samples between 10,500 and 2400 cal BP). This gives considerable confidence to the potential to expand the analyses and develop a richer pattern of biological variability. The resulting data show genetic continuity between archaeological and modern herring populations. The main technical challenge for the future is to extract adequate amounts of nuclear DNA from the ancient samples for identifying more informative DNA markers that can be used to more effectively reveal any population diversity and/or population size changes over time when compared to modern herring.},

Although many ``clam gardens'' or ``clam terraces'' constructed by First Nations have been identified in coastal British Columbia, this is the first that we can attribute to Alaska Natives, in this case, to Tlingit ancestors. The site was identified by Madonna Moss, University of Oregon, and Aaron Bean, Sitka Tribe of Alaska, during archaeological survey in July\textendash August 2011. In this paper we review some of the recent theoretical approaches embedded in the study of these features and urge more explicit use of such theoretical resources. We conclude that although niche construction theory (NCT), resource intensification, resource management and conservation, and traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) provide useful frameworks for understanding these kinds of sites, only traditional ecological knowledge, and indigenous cultural knowledge more generally, have recognized the health risks of shellfish consumption caused by paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP). We suggest that studies of clam gardens must take into consideration such risks, which undoubtedly varied over time and across space.},

An optional buzzer circuit inside the pressure housing allows synchronization of the video data from the FishCam with passive acoustic recorders. Ten FishCam deployments were performed along the east coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada, from January to December 2019. Field tests demonstrate that the proposed system can record up to 212 h of video data over a period of at least 14 days. The FishCam data collected allowed us to identify fish species and observe species interactions and behaviors. The FishCam is an operational, easily-reproduced and inexpensive camera system that can help expand both the temporal and spatial coverage of underwater observations in ecological research.

  abstract = {With global temperatures projected to surpass the limits of thermal tolerance for many species, evaluating the heritable variation underlying thermal tolerance is critical for understanding the potential for adaptation to climate change. We examined the evolutionary potential of thermal tolerance within a population of chinook salmon (               Oncorhynchus tshawytscha               ) by conducting a full-factorial breeding design and measuring the thermal performance of cardiac function and the critical thermal maximum (CT               max               ) of offspring from each family. Additive genetic variation in offspring phenotype was mostly negligible, although these direct genetic effects explained 53\% of the variation in resting heart rate (               f               H               ). Conversely, maternal effects had a significant influence on resting               f               H               , scope for               f               H               , cardiac arrhythmia temperature and CT               max               . These maternal effects were associated with egg size, as indicated by strong relationships between the mean egg diameter of mothers and offspring thermal tolerance. Because egg size can be highly heritable in chinook salmon, our finding indicates that the maternal effects of egg size constitute an indirect genetic effect contributing to thermal tolerance. Such indirect genetic effects could accelerate evolutionary responses to the selection imposed by rising temperatures and could contribute to the population-specific thermal tolerance that has recently been uncovered among Pacific salmon populations.},

One such indicator, the AZTI Marine Biotic Index (AMBI), was designed to establish the ecological quality of European coasts. The index examined the response of soft-bottom benthic communities to natural and man-induced disturbances in coastal and estuarine environments. It has been successfully applied to different geographical areas and under different impact sources, with increasing user numbers in European marine waters (Baltic, North Sea, Atlantic and Mediterranean). The AMBI has been used also for the determination of the ecological quality status (EcoQ) within the context of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD).},

In this analysis of recent ethnoecological studies from the Sonoran Desert, it is clear that O'odham and Comca'ac foragers recognize, name, and interpret ecological interactions among locally occurring species, regardless of whether these species directly benefit them economically. It is demostrated how their knowledge of ecological interactions involving threatened species may offer Western-trained scientists and resource managers hypotheses to test, and to apply to endangered species recovery efforts.

Many anesthetic, sedative, or analgesic drugs used in other vertebrates reduce stress in fish, decrease handling trauma, minimize movement and physiologic changes in response to nociceptive stimuli, and can be used for euthanasia. But extrapolating from limited published anesthetic and sedative data to all fish species is potentially harmful because of marked anatomic, physiologic, and behavioral variations; instead, a stepwise approach to anesthetizing or sedating unfamiliar species or using unproven drugs for familiar species is advisable. Additionally, knowledge of how water quality influences anesthesia or sedation helps limit complications. The most common method of drug administration is through immersion, a technique analogous to gaseous inhalant anesthesia in terrestrial animals, but the use of injectable anesthetic and sedative agents (primarily intramuscularly, but also intravenously) is increasing. Regardless of the route of administration, routine preprocedural preparation is appropriate, to stage both the animals and the supplies for induction, maintenance, and recovery. Anesthetic and sedation monitoring and resuscitation are similar to those for other vertebrates. Euthanasia is most commonly performed using an overdose of an immersion drug but injectable agents are also effective. Analgesia is an area in need of significant research as only a few studies exist and they provide some contrasting results. However, fish have \textmu{} and {$\kappa$} opiate receptors throughout the brain, making it reasonable to expect some effect of at least opioid treatments in fish experiencing noxious stimuli.},

One prominent species, the White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), with spawning populations distributed throughout three large, western North American watersheds (the Sacramento, Columbia, and Fraser rivers), has experienced population declines in the past decade. In 2003, the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada designated all six populations of White Sturgeon in Canada ``endangered.'' To assist sturgeon recovery initiatives in the lower Fraser River (British Columbia), a stewardship-based monitoring and assessment program was developed by the Fraser River Sturgeon Conservation Society. A descriptive population model was developed to provide reliable annual population estimates by size/age group and location, based on tag release and recapture data collected by trained volunteers. As of January 2011, the population estimate (from 40- to 279-cm fork length) was 44,713 (95\% confidence level 42,634\textendash 46,792). Group size analyses suggest that abundance decreases have been greatest for juvenile sturgeon under 100-cm fork length. Recruitment decline may be the result of several factors, including destruction of important spawning and early life history rearing habitats; fewer successful adult spawners due to in-river fisheries; and/or impacts of reduced food supply and ecological imbalances on both early life and adult stages.},

Mussels on rafts filtered about 83106 L/h and consumed about 40 g chlorophyll a (chl a)/h under favorable conditions. Because of the drag of the culture ropes and predator nets, velocity inside the rafts was reduced by 75\%\textendash 80\% in relation to ambient conditions. Chlorophyll consumption by mussels increased with increased food (chl a) concentration and also with increased water velocity inside the rafts. Clearance rates per raft also increased with food concentration. Model results allow for an estimation of water flux and seston depletion within the rafts through the use of point measurements and correction factors. Water velocity measurements taken mid depth in the middle of the rafts underestimated the mean flow through the raft by 10\%. Measurements of current velocity and chl a concentration taken mid depth in the middle of the rafts underestimated the mean particle consumption rates by 13\%. Model results and field data indicate that mussel raft hydrodynamics are a function of raft orientation to current direction, mussel raft size, raft aspect ratio, the presence of predator nets, the presence of multiple rafts, rope spacing, and rope diameter. Mussel raft design, placement, and biomass may be adjusted to optimize hydrodynamics and conditions favorable for improved mussel growth rates. Recommended flow speeds through experimental mussel rafts with a cross-sectional area of 121 m2 require a minimum outside flow speed of 14\textendash 23 cm/sec.},

  abstract = {The inherent sampling and preservational biases of the archaeological record make it difficult to quantify prehistoric human diets, especially in coastal settings, where populations had access to a wide range of marine and terrestrial food sources. In certain cases, geochemical proxies such as stable isotope ratios may be utilized to provide robust estimates on the relative proportions of various food resources consumed by prehistoric populations. The Harkins Slough archaeological site (SCR-60/130) is an early to middle Holocene coastal assemblage located on Monterey Bay in central CA. The carbon (d13C) and nitrogen (d15N) isotope composition of human burials and associated archaeofauna excavated from the site were measured for input into a concentration-dependent isotope mixing model that is able to statistically discriminate among multiple (O3) food sources. The human burials segregate into two distinct groups, an early (w7000 bp) and middle (w4500 bp) Holocene population with significant dietary differences. Stable isotope analyses indicate a 70e84\% marine food source contribution for the early Holocene group (EHG), but only a 48e58\% marine dietary contribution for the middle Holocene group (MHG). Results also suggest that pinnipeds were an important marine food source for both groups. Modeling results are in agreement with archaeological evidence from southern CA, suggesting that early Holocene coastal populations were highly dependent on marine resources, with the ability to procure both littoral and pelagic species. Further, the use of terrestrial plant sources likely increased over time, with the feasible contribution range doubling from the EHG (4e30\%, mean 19\%) to MHG (10e52\%, mean 38\%). This trend is supported by regional archaeological evidence for the advent of technological innovations linked to intensive terrestrial plant processing beginning in the middle Holocene. Methodologically, this work demonstrated the utility of a concentration-dependent stable isotope mixing model in an iterative framework to provide feasible ranges of dietary contribution when the number of food sources is too high to allow a unique solution.},

Northern fur seals (NFS;               Callorhinus ursinus               ) are a common pinniped species in archaeological sites from southern California to the Aleutian Islands, yet today they breed almost exclusively on offshore islands at high latitudes. Harvest profiles from archaeological sites contain many unweaned pups, confirming the presence of temperate-latitude breeding colonies in California, the Pacific Northwest, and the eastern Aleutian Islands. Isotopic results suggest that prehistoric NFS fed offshore across their entire range, that California populations were distinct from populations to the north, and that populations breeding at temperate latitudes in the past used a different reproductive strategy than modern populations. The extinction of temperate-latitude breeding populations was asynchronous geographically. In southern California, the Pacific Northwest, and the eastern Aleutians, NFS remained abundant in the archaeological record up to the historical period {$\approx$}200 years B.P.; thus their regional collapse is plausibly attributed to historical hunting or some other anthropogenic ecosystem disturbance. In contrast, NFS populations in central and northern California collapsed at {$\approx$}800 years B.P., long before European contact. The relative roles of human hunting versus climatic factors in explaining this ecological shift are unclear, as more paleoclimate information is needed from the coastal zone.},

  abstract = {An important assumption of many environmental decisions is that some patterns or combinations of land cover are optimal or more preferable to others. Management plans frequently seek to change the structure of a landscape to realise particular management goals, because it is recognized that the spatial arrangement of elements in a land cover mosaic control the ecological processes which operate within it. This study reviews some of the tools available to those who need to describe and understand the spatial structure of landscapes. In particular, it examines the way in which quantitative measures, or indices, can be used and what contribution they might make to the management of forested landscapes in the UK. The paper discusses the way in which the different landscape indices can be used to assess the spatial implications of the various design guidelines that have been proposd to promote sustainable forms of forestry. It is concluded that while progress has been made in the development of a range of landscape pattern measures, and in our understanding of the factors constraining their use, there is a pressing need for further research into the relationship between landscape pattern and ecological process.},

We compared noise levels at three RCAs with adjacent unprotected reference sites from August 2018\textendash June 2019. While RCAs had lower levels of noise overall than reference sites, this trend was inconsistent; some RCA sites had higher levels of noise during certain time periods than non-RCA sites. A vessel noise detector was the best predictor of noise level over three frequency bands (20\textendash 100 Hz, 100\textendash 1000 Hz, 1\textendash 10 kHz), and predicted sound levels which could mask rockfish communication. We conclude that RCAs do not reliably protect rockfish from noise pollution, and recommend further study into potential impacts on stock recovery.},

  abstract = {Biogenic habitat structure, such as that created by foundation macrophytes, shapes the interactions of higher trophic level organisms by creating three-dimensional refuge spaces. In recent decades, many kelp habitats have transformed into turf-dominated communities. This represents a fundamental change in the overall habitat structure in these communities, with an unknown impact on upper trophic level organisms. We investigated how macroalgae morphology affects a common residential mid-trophic level wrasse, Tautogolabrus adspersus (cunner), which utilizes macroalgae for both refuge and foraging. Three studies were conducted: in situ behavioral video observations, a refuge choice experiment, and a foraging efficiency experiment. Video observations revealed that in kelp-dominated and mixed habitat types cunner use macroalgae more often for refuge than for foraging, but in turf-dominated habitats refuge and foraging events were equal. In these habitats, refuge-seeking was more often associated with a tall, morphologically simple kelp. The refuge choice experiment supported our video observations with cunner preferentially seeking refuge beneath taller but less morphologically complex algae instead of shorter filamentous forms. In predation trials, macroalgae complexity did not significantly affect the number of prey the fish captured. Our results provide evidence that the refuge-seeking behavior of this residential mid-trophic level fish may be impacted by the ongoing shifts in macroalgae dominance in the Gulf of Maine. Loss of its preferred refuge (tall, canopy-forming kelps) may force it to use the less-preferred introduced turf algae instead. However, whether turf provides sufficient protection for this species remains unclear. With the ongoing loss of kelp in temperate coastal ecosystems worldwide, it is important to understand the potential indirect effects that changes in habitat structure will have on the trophic interactions of upper level organisms.},

Paci\textregistered c herring and hake remains make up over 90\% of the identi\textregistered able remains. Cores from ODP leg 169S covered the entire Holocene; scale recovery is poor, so the record is based on fragmented bones. Bones associated with the backbone, gill arches and \textregistered ns yield the best taxonomic information. In both core sets, low-frequency signals are resolved using a \textregistered ve-sample running mean. Because the data series in the short cores are autocorrelated, spectral analysis is the best approach to identify high-frequency signals that explain much variance in the scale data. High cross-spectral coherencies con\textregistered rm a basin-wide signal in scale deposition. The herring scale deposition data are compared to recent \textregistered shery biomass estimates and con\textregistered rm similarities in timing of low-frequency trends and signals. Experiments with herring in large tanks explore the transfer of scales from \textregistered sh to the ocean \textasciimacron oor; shedding and predation are found to provide a regular rain of scales to the sediments. Overall, the sedimentary \textregistered sh remains record in basins with good preservation shows promise as a means to identify generalized long-term \textregistered sh histories through the Holocene as well as a more speci\textregistered c Paci\textregistered c herring and hake story over the last century. q 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {The persistence of ecological systems in changing environments requires energy, materials, and information. Although the importance of information to ecological function has been widely recognized, the fundamental principles of ecological science as commonly expressed do not reflect this central role of information processing. We articulate five fundamental principles of ecology that integrate information with energy and material constraints across scales of organization in living systems. We show how these principles outline new theoretical and empirical research challenges, and offer one novel attempt to incorporate them in a theoretical model. To provide adequate background for the principles, we review major concepts and identify common themes and key differences in information theories spanning physics, biology and semiotics. We structured our review around a series of questions about the role information may play in ecological systems: (i) what is information? (ii) how is information related to uncertainty? (iii) what is information processing? (iv) does information processing link ecological systems across scales? We highlight two aspects of information that capture its dual roles: syntactic information defining the processes that encode, filter and process information stored in biological structure and semiotic information associated with structures and their context. We argue that the principles of information in living systems promote a unified approach to understanding living systems in terms of first principles of biology and physics, and promote much needed theoretical and empirical advances in ecological research to unify understanding across disciplines and scales.},

  abstract = {The Gulf of California (GC) is a semi-closed sea in the Tropical Eastern Pacific and is recognised as a highly diverse marine ecosystem. Despite this status, this region is still poorly studied in comparison to other marine hotspots. To start filling this gap, we attempt to provide a global overview of reef-fish diversity around the numerous islands of the region. We evaluated species richness, the abundance and biomass, and the functional diversity of the fish assemblages for the major islands of the GC. We first highlight that the southwestern part of the central GC is the hotspot of reef-fishes diversity within the GC, in terms of species richness, functional diversity, and fish abundance. We then found out an important functional divergence between fish assemblages of northern and southern regions. The fish biomass of each region is dominated by different species, characterised by different ecological traits (the opposite of functional convergence). This functional divergence may be explained by an important oceanographic heterogeneity along the latitudinal axis of the GC. The northern part shows larger climate fluctuations while the southern part is more tropical and climatically stable. Such functional divergence is a biodiversity facet to take into account when determining the sites to focus conservation action. In the GC, this criterion allows the importance of some sites to be highlighted to preserve the legacy of the reef-fishes, despite their lower diversity levels.},

A combined molecular and immunohistochemical approach has been used in this work for pinpointing cellular and humoral immune factors in gill tissue involved in the response and indicating interactions between the systemic and local responses. Fish were immunized by intra-peritoneal injection of live I. multifiliis theronts, control fish were injected with PBS and subgroups were treated with the immuno-suppressant hydrocortisone before fish were challenged with live theronts. Significant up-regulations of genes encoding IgM, IgT, C3, SAA, IL-8, IL-22 and IFN-g were induced by immunization and challenge. Hydrocortisone treatment had a significant down-regulating effect on genes incoding IgT, IgM, CD4, CD8, IFN-g, IL-8 and IL-22 in all groups. Immunohistochemistry, using monoclonal antibodies to detect cellular markers, demonstrated active involvement of CD8, MHC II, IgT and IgM positive cells in gill tissue. Putative T-cells (CD8 positive cells) were detected in the intraepithelial lymphoid tissue located at the base of gill filaments and in hyperplastic gill tissue but following infection a clear efflux of these cells was detected. MHC II positive cells were distributed across the gill filaments and accumulated in hyperplastic tissue but hydrocortisone treatment affected their density negatively in both immunized and non-immunized fish. IgT positive cells were present in the epithelial lining of the gill lamellae (suggesting a primary role of this protein in the mucosal defence against the ciliate) whereas IgM positive cells were found only in gill arterioles and the lamellar capillaries. The present work indicates an intensive activity and specialized function of immune cells (B-cells, T-cells and macrophages) and humoral elements such as immunoglobulins IgT and IgM which are orchestrated by cytokines in gill tissue reacting against I. multifiliis.},

  abstract = {A naive realization of JSON data in R maps JSON arrays to an unnamed list, and JSON objects to a named list. However, in practice a list is an awkward, inefficient type to store and manipulate data. Most statistical applications work with (homogeneous) vectors, matrices or data frames. Therefore JSON packages in R typically define certain special cases of JSON structures which map to simpler R types. Currently there exist no formal guidelines, or even consensus between implementations on how R data should be represented in JSON. Furthermore, upon closer inspection, even the most basic data structures in R actually do not perfectly map to their JSON counterparts and leave some ambiguity for edge cases. These problems have resulted in different behavior between implementations and can lead to unexpected output. This paper explicitly describes a mapping between R classes and JSON data, highlights potential problems, and proposes conventions that generalize the mapping to cover all common structures. We emphasize the importance of type consistency when using JSON to exchange dynamic data, and illustrate using examples and anecdotes. The jsonlite R package is used throughout the paper as a reference implementation.},

  abstract = {Ecosystem engineers that increase habitat complexity are keystone species in marine systems, increasing shelter and niche availability, and therefore biodiversity. For example, kelp holdfasts form intricate structures and host the largest number of organisms in kelp ecosystems. However, methods that quantify 3D habitat complexity have only seldom been used in marine habitats, and never in kelp holdfast communities. This study investigated the role of kelp holdfasts (Laminaria hyperborea) in supporting benthic faunal biodiversity. Computer-aided tomography (CT-) scanning was used to quantify the three-dimensional geometrical complexity of holdfasts, including volume, surface area and surface fractal dimension (FD). Additionally, the number of haptera, number of haptera per unit of volume, and age of kelps were estimated. These measurements were compared to faunal biodiversity and community structure, using partial least-squares regression and multivariate ordination. Holdfast volume explained most of the variance observed in biodiversity indices, however all other complexity measures also strongly contributed to the variance observed. Multivariate ordinations further revealed that surface area and haptera per unit of volume accounted for the patterns observed in faunal community structure. Using 3D image analysis, this study makes a strong contribution to elucidate quantitative mechanisms underlying the observed relationship between biodiversity and habitat complexity. Furthermore, the potential of CT-scanning as an ecological tool is demonstrated, and a methodology for its use in future similar studies is established. Such spatially resolved imager analysis could help identify structurally complex areas as biodiversity hotspots, and may support the prioritization of areas for conservation.},

To facilitate the integration between conceptual and statistical approaches in community ecology, we propose Hierarchical Modelling of Species Communities (HMSC) as a general, flexible framework for modern analysis of community data. While non-manipulative data allow for only correlative and not causal inference, this framework facilitates the formulation of data-driven hypotheses regarding the processes that structure communities. We model environmental filtering by variation and covariation in the responses of individual species to the characteristics of their environment, with potential contingencies on species traits and phylogenetic relationships. We capture biotic assembly rules by species-to-species association matrices, which may be estimated at multiple spatial or temporal scales. We operationalise the HMSC framework as a hierarchical Bayesian joint species distribution model, and implement it as R- and Matlab-packages which enable computationally efficient analyses of large data sets. Armed with this tool, community ecologists can make sense of many types of data, including spatially explicit data and time-series data. We illustrate the use of this framework through a series of diverse ecological examples.},

In particular, noticeable effect has been attained in the field of microbial ecology, where new experimental approaches provided in-depth assessments of the composition, functions and dynamic changes of complex microbial communities. Because even a single high-throughput experiment produces large amount of data, powerful statistical techniques of multivariate analysis are well suited to analyse and interpret these data sets. Many different multivariate techniques are available, and often it is not clear which method should be applied to a particular data set. In this review, we describe and compare the most widely used multivariate statistical techniques including exploratory, interpretive and discriminatory procedures. We consider several important limitations and assumptions of these methods, and we present examples of how these approaches have been utilized in recent studies to provide insight into the ecology of the microbial world. Finally, we offer suggestions for the selection of appropriate methods based on the research question and data set structure.},

  abstract = {Shifting baseline syndrome (SBS) is often referred to as a key issue for conservation, yet there is little evidence for its existence. The presence of SBS could influence the validity of participatory monitoring, local ecological knowledge, community based conservation, and conservation education. We outline two forms of SBS: (1) generational amnesia, where knowledge extinction occurs because younger generations are not aware of past biological conditions and (2) personal amnesia, where knowledge extinction occurs as individuals forget their own experience. Two conditions are essential to the identification of SBS: (1) biological change must be present in the system and (2) any perceived changes must be consistent with the biological data. If age or experiencerelated differences in perception are then found, generational amnesia may be occurring. Alternately, if individuals believe current conditions also occurred in the past, personal amnesia may be occurring. Previous studies have not fully addressed these conditions, and hence cannot provide indisputable evidence for the existence of SBS. We present three case studies to examine these issues, which demonstrate both forms of SBS. Shifting baseline syndrome is no longer a cautionary tale, but instead is a real problem for those using human perceptions of change to inform conservation policy-making or management.},

There is a projected need to double food production by 2050. In recent times, the trend has been for incremental modest yield increases for most crops. There is an urgent need to develop integrated and sustainable approaches that will significantly increase both production per unit land area and the resource use efficiency of crops. This review considers some key processes involved in plant growth and development with some examples of ways in which molecular technology, plant breeding and genetics may increase the yield and resource use efficiency of wheat. The successful application of biotechnology to breeding is essential to provide the major increases in production required. However, each crop and each specific agricultural situation presents specific requirements and targets for optimisation. Some increases in production will come about as new varieties are developed which are able to produce satisfactory crops on marginal land presently not considered appropriate for arable crops. Other new varieties will be developed to increase both yield and resource use efficiency on the best land.},

In this article, 2 studies exploring the effects of teacher enthusiasm on both students' intrinsic motivation to learn and their pychological vitality are presented (Ryan \& Frederick, 1997). In Study 1, a questionnaire including measures of intrinsic motivation, vitality, teacher enthusiasm, and numerous other positive teacher behaviors was administered to 93 college students. Among the teacher variables, enthusiasm was the most powerful unique predictor of students' intrinsic motivation and vitality. In Study 2, level of teacher enthusiasm (high vs. low) was manipulated in an experimental design with 60 college students. The students who received an enthusiastically delivered lecture subsequently reported greater intrinsic motivation regarding the lecture material and experienced higher levels of vitality. The authors speculate about possible mechanisms for and limitations to the positive motivational effects of teacher enthusiasm.},

There was an interactive effect of root mean square (RMS) velocity (0, 1.3, 2.7, 5.5, and 18.3 cm{$\cdot$}s-1) and turbidity (0, 30, and 60 nephelometric turbidity units; NTU) on perch feeding on phantom midge larvae (Chaoborus flavicans). In the 0 and 60 NTU conditions, there was no significant change in the feeding efficiency of perch. However, at 30 NTU, increasing turbulence enhanced perch feeding by increasing encounter rates and disabling the prey escape response. The proportion of encountered Chaoborus larvae that were consumed showed a linear decline with increasing turbulence under clear and 30 NTU conditions and a dome-shaped response under 60 NTU. The results indicate that turbulence has a strong effect on the post-encounter stages of the foraging cycle.},

  abstract = {Globally, coastlines are under pressure as coastal human population growth and urbanization continues, while climatic change leads to stormier seas and rising tides. These trends create a strong and sustained demand for land reclamation and infrastructure protection in coastal areas, requiring engineered coastal defence structures such as sea walls. Here, we review the nature of ecological impacts of coastal structures on intertidal ecosystems, seek to understand the extent to which ecological engineering can mitigate these impacts, and evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation as a tool to contribute to conservation of intertidal habitats. By so doing, we identify critical knowledge gaps to inform future research. Coastal structures alter important physical, chemical and biological processes of intertidal habitats, and strongly impact community structure, inter-habitat linkages and ecosystem services while also driving habitat loss. Such impacts occur diffusely across localised sites but scale to significant regional and global levels. Recent advances in ecological engineering have focused on developing habitat complexity on coastal structures to increase biodiversity. `Soft' engineering options maximise habitat complexity through inclusion of natural materials, species and processes, while simultaneously delivering engineering objectives such as coastal protection. Soft options additionally sustain multiple services, providing greater economic benefits for society, and resilience to climatic change. Currently however, a lack of inclusion and economic undervaluation of intertidal ecosystem services may undermine best practice in coastline management. Importantly, reviewed evidence shows mitigation and even restoration do not support intertidal communities or processes equivalent to pre-disturbance conditions. Crucially, an absence of comprehensive empirical baseline biodiversity data, or data comprising additional ecological parameters such as ecosystem functions and services, prohibits quantification of absolute and relative magnitudes of ecological impacts due to coastal structures or effectiveness of mitigation interventions. This knowledge deficit restricts evaluation of the potential of ecological engineering to contribute to conservation policies for intertidal habitats. To improve mitigation design and effectiveness, a greater focus on in-situ research is needed, requiring stronger and timely collaboration between government agencies, construction partners and research scientists.},

  abstract = {Genetic admixture between wild and introduced populations is a rising concern for the management of endangered species. Here, we use a dual approach based on molecular analyses of samples collected before and after hatchery fish introduction in combination with a simulation study to obtain insight into the mechanisms of admixture in wild populations. Using 17 microsatellites, we genotyped pre- and post-stocking samples from four Atlantic salmon populations supplemented with non-native fish to estimate genetic admixture. We also used individual-based temporally explicit simulations based on realistic demographic and stocking data to predict the extent of admixture. We found a low admixture by hatchery stocks within prestocking samples but moderate to high values in poststocking samples (from 12\% to 60\%). The simulation scenarios best fitting the real data suggested a 10\textendash 25 times lower survival of stocked fish relative to wild individuals. Simulations also suggested relatively high dispersal rates of stocked and wild fish, which may explain some high levels of admixture in weakly stocked populations and the persistence of indigenous genotypes in heavily stocked populations. This study overall demonstrates that combining genetic analyses with simulations can significantly improve the understanding of admixture mechanisms in wild populations.},

Here, we evaluated the contribution of Atlantic salmon mature male parr to the effective number of breeders (Nb) using both demographic (variance in reproductive success) and genetic (linkage disequilibrium) methods, the number of alleles, and the relatedness among breeders. We used a recently published pedigree reconstruction of a wild anadromous Atlantic salmon population in which 2548 fry born in 2010 were assigned parentage to 144 anadromous female and 101 anadromous females that returned to the river to spawn in 2009 and to 462 mature male parr. Demographic and genetic methods revealed that mature male parr increased population Nb by 1.79 and 1.85 times, respectively. Moreover, mature male parr boosted the number of alleles found among progenies. Finally, mature male parr were in average less related to anadromous females than were anadromous males, likely because of asynchronous sexual maturation between mature male parr and anadromous fish of a given cohort. By increasing Nb and allelic richness, and by decreasing inbreeding, the reproductive contribution of mature male parr has important evolutionary and conservation implications for declining Atlantic salmon populations.},

  abstract = {The problem with pure recombinant or synthetic antigens used in modern day vaccines is that they are generally far less immunogenic than older style live or killed whole organism vaccines. This has created a major need for improved and more powerful adjuvants for use in these vaccines. With few exceptions, alum remains the sole adjuvant approved for human use in the majority of countries worldwide. Although alum is able to induce a good antibody (Th2) response, it has little capacity to stimulate cellular (Th1) immune responses which are so important for protection against many pathogens. In addition, alum has the potential to cause severe local and systemic side-effects including sterile abscesses, eosinophilia and myofascitis, although fortunately most of the more serious side-effects are relatively rare. There is also community concern regarding the possible role of aluminium in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Consequently, there is a major unmet need for safer and more effective adjuvants suitable for human use. In particular, there is demand for safe and non-toxic adjuvants able to stimulate cellular (Th1) immunity. Other needs in light of new vaccine technologies are adjuvants suitable for use with mucosally-delivered vaccines, DNA vaccines, cancer and autoimmunity vaccines. Each of these areas are highly specialized with their own unique needs in respect of suitable adjuvant technology. This paper reviews the state of the art in the adjuvant field, explores future directions of adjuvant development and finally examines some of the impediments and barriers to development and registration of new human adjuvants.},

  abstract = {Contemporary Western attitudes concerning the management of natural resources, treatment of nonhuman animals, and the natural world emerge from traditions derived from Western European philosophy, i.e., they assume that humans are autonomous from, and in control of, the natural world. A different approach is presented by Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) of indigenous peoples of North America. Although spiritually oriented, TEK converges on Western scientific approaches. TEK is based on close observation of nature and natural phenomena; however, it is combined with a concept of community membership that differs from that of Western political and social thought. TEK is strongly tied to specific physical localities; therefore, all aspects of the physical space can be considered part of the community, including animals, plants, and landforms. As a consequence, native worldviews can be considered to be spatially oriented, in contrast to the temporal orientation of Western political and historical thought. TEK also emphasizes the idea that individual plants and animals exist on their own terms. This sense of place and concern for individuals leads to two basic TEK concepts: (1) all things are connected, which is conceptually related to Western community ecology, and (2) all things are related, which changes the emphasis from the human to the ecological community as the focus of theories concerning nature. Connectedness and relatedness are involved in the clan systems of many indigenous peoples, where nonhuman organisms are recognized as relatives whom the humans are obliged to treat with respect and honor. Convergence of TEK and Western science suggests that there may be areas in which TEK can contribute insights, or possibly even new concepts, to Western science. TEK is inherently multidisciplinary in that it links the human and the nonhuman, and is the basis not only for indigenous concepts of nature, but also for concepts of indigenous politics and ethics. This multidisciplinary aspect suggests that TEK may be useful in resolving conflicts involving a variety of stakeholders and interest groups in controversies over natural resource use, animal rights, and conservation. TEK may also have implications for human behavior and obligations toward other forms of life that are often unrecognized, or at least not emphasized, in Western science. We present examples from community and behavioral ecology where a TEK-based approach yielded unexpected and nonintuitive insights into natural phenomena. Understanding of TEK may be useful in helping scientists respond to the changing public perceptions of science, and new cultural pressures in our society.},

Triploids, organisms with three sets of homologous chromosomes, are found spontaneously in both wild and cultured populations and can be easily induced in many commercially relevant species of fish and shellfish. The major consequence of triploidy is gonadal sterility, which is of advantage in the aquaculture of molluscs since it can result in superior growth. In fish, the induction of triploidy is mainly used to avoid problems associated with sexual maturation such as lower growth rates, increased incidence of diseases and deterioration of the organoleptic properties. Triploidy can also be used to increase the viability of some hybrids, and is regarded as a potential method for the genetic containment of farmed shellfish and fish. This review focuses on some current issues related to the application of induced polyploidy in aquaculture, namely: 1) the artificial induction of polyploidy and the effectiveness of current triploidisation techniques, including the applicability of tetraploidy to generate autoand allotriploids; 2) the performance capacity of triploids with respect to diploids; 3) the degree and permanence of gonadal sterility in triploids; and 4) the prospects for the potential future generalised use of triploids to avoid the genetic impact of escapees of farmed fish and shellfish on wild populations. Finally, directions for future research on triploids and their implementation are discussed.},

An average 2- to 3-year phase shift was detected between the canary rockfish and a Pacific halibut reference chronology that was likely the result of differences in the regional oceanography or underageing bias. The assumption of ageing bias consistency was tested with two sampling designs. The first design controled for agerelated ageing error, and the second design related birth year to estimated age. No change in the magnitude of ageing bias as a function of age was detected.},

The assemblages present on two rock ledges were compared: Washing Ledge, which is regularly visited and utilized by people, and Yellow Ledge, which is more isolated and visited much less regularly. At each ledge, three habitat types were investigated: open rock, rockpools and the fucoid zone. Multivariate statistical analysis revealed significant differences in assemblages between ledges and among habitat types. The differences observed in the communities of the two ledges can be explained to some extent by natural ecological processes, but human impacts were also detected. The most obvious contrast associated with trampling was a reduction in the larger, branching species of algae and an increase in ephemeral and crustose species in the more heavily utilized areas.},

  abstract = {We explored changes in western Mediterranean fishery and aquaculture landings using trophic level (TL) estimates derived from nitrogen stable isotope analysis combined with geographically detailed fishery data collated by the General Fisheries Council for the Mediterranean (GFCM). Our analyses confirmed earlier suggestions that there has been a significant decline in the mean trophic level of Mediterranean landings (by -0.15 TL over 26 years). However, this decline is suggested to be almost entirely a result of increased landings of bivalve molluscs from mariculture and not due to changes in landings from capture fisheries. The mean trophic level of finfish landings has not changed significantly since 1973, although both fish and total landings have become significantly more diverse. Inspection of small pelagic fish landings revealed a marked decrease in the contribution played by anchovy and replacement of this species by sardine. Since 1981, cage culture of high trophic level species such as sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) and seabream (Sparus aurata) has become increasingly important, such that when clupeoid landings were excluded from the analyses, the mean trophic level of finfish landings was actually demonstrated to have increased over the past 26 years.},

Movements of nutrients, detritus, prey, and consumers among habitats are ubiquitous in diverse biomes and can strongly influence population, consumer-resource, food web, and community dynamics. Nutrient and detrital subsidies usually increase primary and secondary productivity, both directly and indirectly. Prey subsidies, by movement of either prey or predators, usually enhance predator abundance beyond what local resources can support. Top-down effects occur when spatially subsidized consumers affect local resources by suppressing key resources and occasionally by initiating trophic cascades. Effects on community dynamics vary with the relative amount of input, the trophic roles of the mobile and recipient entities, and the local food web structure. Landscape variables such as the perimeter/area ratio of the focal habitat, permeability of habitat boundaries, and relative productivity of trophically connected habitats affect the degree and importance of spatial subsidization.},

Greater species richness and diversity were noted in the low intertidal zones. There was a negative relationship between REPI and species richness, suggesting that increasing anthropogenic pressure has decreased benthic richness. The factors associated with the loss of richness were jetties built to control erosion, urban areas, beachfront kiosks and restaurants, fish markets, and storm sewers with illegal sewage connections. Our results highlight the need for better infrastructure planning and rigorous monitoring of coastal urban areas, since the large influence of multiple human pressures in these reefs leads to biodiversity losses.},

Especially for North Atlantic and Japanese fisheries historical data have been retrieved from archives and museums, which cover time spans of 50\textendash 350 years. This makes it possible to examine natural variability of fish stocks over a much longer time span than what is normally possible with modern survey data and commercial catch data. Furthermore, historical evidence from the pre-industrialized period have the benefit of stemming from a period in time, when fishing had an insignificant impact on the abundance of open sea fish stocks. The best material comes from cod and herring fisheries, where it is possible to reconstruct CPUE as accurate as catch per boat per day absent, as well as changing spatial distribution over longer time periods.},

Macroscale rapid ecological assessments (REAs) of algal assemblages provide managers of coral reefs and other benthic ecosystems with the fundamental descriptive data necessary for continued yearly monitoring studies. The high cost of monitoring marine communities, especially remote sites, coupled with the time limitations imposed by scuba, require that statistically valid data be collected as quickly as possible. A photoquadrat method using a digital camera, computer software for photographic analysis, and minimal data collection in the field was compared with the conventional method of point-intersect (grid) quadrats in estimating percentage cover in subtidal benthic communities. In timed studies, photoquadrats yielded twice the number of quadrats (and an almost infinite number of data points) as conventional methods, provided permanent historical records of each site, and minimized observer bias by having only one observer identifying algae in the field. However, photoquadrats required more post-collection computer analyses of digital photographs than conventional methods. In the manual method, observer bias in algal identification can occur depending on the degree of experience of individual divers. On the other hand, photoquadrats rely on one observer in the field and one observer in the laboratory, standardizing algal identification. Overall, photoquadrats do not yield the finer resolution in diversity that was found using point-intersect quadrats but do provide a more precise estimate of percentage cover of the abundant species, as well as establishing a permanent visual record in the time allowed by work with other teams.},

  abstract = {The enhancement of salmon populations has long been used to increase the abundance of salmon returning to spawn and/ or to be captured in fisheries. However, in some instances enhancement can have adverse impacts on adjacent nonenhanced populations. In Canada's Skeena watershed, smolt-to-adult survival of Babine Lake sockeye from 1962\textendash 2002 was inversely related to the abundance of sockeye smolts leaving Babine Lake. This relationship has led to the concern that Babine Lake smolt production, which is primarily enhanced by spawning channels, may depress wild Skeena (Babine and non-Babine) sockeye populations as a result of increased competition between wild and enhanced sockeye smolts as they leave their natal lakes and co-migrate to sea. To test this hypothesis we used data on Skeena sockeye populations and oceanographic conditions to statistically examine the relationship between Skeena sockeye productivity (adult salmon produced per spawner) and an index of Babine Lake enhanced smolt abundance while accounting for the potential influence of early marine conditions. While we had relatively high power to detect large effects, we did not find support for the hypothesis that the productivity of wild Skeena sockeye is inversely related to the abundance of enhanced sockeye smolts leaving Babine Lake in a given year. Importantly, life-time productivity of Skeena sockeye is only partially explained by marine survival, and likely is an unreliable measure of the influence of smolt abundance. Limitations to our analyses, which include: (1) the reliance upon adult salmon produced per spawner (rather than per smolt) as an index of marine survival, and (2) incomplete age structure for most of the populations considered, highlight uncertainties that should be addressed if understanding relationships between wild and enhanced sockeye is a priority in the Skeena.},

We examined the development of reef communities (oyster, barnacle and motile epibenthic macrofauna), characterized nekton use and assessed the habitat value of the constructed reef. The C. rivularis oyster population showed a rapid exponential increase with time and reached maximum density (3410 {$\pm$} 241 ind./m2) and biomass (3175 {$\pm$} 532 g/m2) after one year of restoration. The barnacle Balanus albicostatus was the most abundant sessile macrofauna and had a significantly greater density in the high intertidal zone than in the low intertidal zone (P {$<$} 0.05). The reef also supported diverse motile epibenthic macrofauna (11 mollusks, 11 crustaceans, 4 annelids and 2 fishes), and the reef-associated communities were numerically dominated by Neanthes japonica, Perinereis aibuhitensis, Nerita yoldi and Littorinopsis intermedia. A total of 50 nekton species (31 fishes, 9 shrimps and 10 crabs) utilized the constructed intertidal oyster reef, and grass shrimp Palaemon spp. dominated the nekton communities in term of abundance. Since the constructed intertidal oyster reef supports a variety of reef communities and abundant nektons, it should be recognized as an important and protective fish habitat in the Yangtze River estuary.},

The distribution of fish species in three freshwater habitats in the Jurumirim Reservoir, Brazil, was examined using both species richness and the relative proportions of different trophic groups. These groups were used as a proxy for functional structure in an attempt to test the ability of these measures to assess fish diversity. Assemblage structures were first described using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). The influence of environmental conditions for multiple fish assemblage response variables (richness, total abundance and abundance per trophic group) was tested using generalised linear mixed models (GLMM). The metric typically employed to describe diversity; that is, species richness, was not related to environmental conditions. However, absolute species abundance was relatively well explained with up to 54\% of the variation in the observed data accounted for. Differences in the dominance of trophic groups were most apparent in response to the presence of introduced fish species: the iliophagous and piscivorous trophic groups were positively associated, while detritivores and herbivores were negatively associated, with the alien species. This suggests that monitoring functional diversity might be more valuable than species diversity for assessing effects of disturbances and managements policies on the fish community.},

  abstract = {Trends in abundance of spring and summer chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and steelhcad Salmo gairdneri returning to the Snake River and mid-Columbia River above Priest Rapids Dam were determined by analyzing the percentage of adults returning from the smoll out-migrations of 1962-1984. Runs declined as a result of hydroelectric development of the river, the main cause for the decline was the mortality of juveniles migrating downstream through as many as nine dams and impoundments en route to the ocean. Mid-Columbia River summer chinook salmon runs experienced thegreatest decline because of higher mortalities incurred during their migration to sea as subyearlings in July and August. Mortality was lower for remaining races of fish that migrate to sea as yearlings in the spring during higher river flows, more spill at dams, and cooler water temperatures. Enhancement measures to offset dam-related mortality of smolts began in 1970 on the Snake River and in 1975 on the mid-Columbia River. These measures included increased numbers of smolts released from hatcheries, spillway deflectors to reduce dissolved gas saturation, fingerling bypasses at dams, transportation of smolts around dams, supplemental river flows to minimizedelay for smolts passing through reservoirs, and supplemental spill at dams to minimizeturbine mortality of smolts at dams without fingerling bypasses. These actions have reversed the decline of steelhead but not of salmon. Enhancement has improved the rate of return of wild spring chinook salmon, but wild fish contribution is minimal at this time because stocks were reduced by earlier hydroelectric development. Presently, runs are mostly of hatchery origin and have not responded well to enhancement. Mortality of hatchery fish may be due to activation of bacterial kidney disease by stresses encountered during downriver migrations, transportation, or subsequent transition into seawater.},

  abstract = {Identifying phenotype-specific selective landscapes within populations continues to challenge evolutionary biologists in studies of adaptive variation. We explore here the potential application of carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios of tissues as time-integrated proxies of niche space among sex, armour and asymmetry phenotypes within an endemic population of giant threespine stickleback from Haida Gwaii, western Canada. Muscle tissues were extracted from 289 stickleback collected from Drizzle Lake, taken in transects during June 1981, June 1982, September 1982 and June 1983 and isotopic ratios of 15N/14N ({$\delta$}15N) and 13C/12C ({$\delta$}13C) determined by continuous-flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry. Among all fish, {$\delta$}15N values, which reflect relative trophic level, ranged from 6.5h to 10.6h while {$\delta$}13C, which reflects reliance on different carbon pathways of primary producers, ranged from -30.5h to -27.5h. The sexes did not differ in {$\delta$}15N but females were significantly enriched in {$\delta$}13C relative to males among all samples. In each transect, lateral plate phenotypes differed in {$\delta$}15N, with higher plate counts generally enriched in 15N. {$\delta$}13C did not vary among plate phenotypes. Approximately 50\% of the adult population exhibit lateral plate asymmetries usually with one plate different between sides. Sticklebacks that were asymmetric (absolute asymmetry) did not differ from symmetric fish for either {$\delta$}15N or {$\delta$}13C signatures. However, this result masked a significant and consistent effect of signed asymmetries (right side - left side), with {$\delta$}15N enrichment among right-biased compared to left-biased asymmetric. These unexpected results indicate the presence of subtle and previously unrecognized niche differences in lateral plate number and asymmetry phenotypes and are consistent with the predictions of niche-width and adaptive variation hypotheses. The results also suggest the wider application of isotopic techniques to elucidate phenotype-specific ecological and selective landscapes.},

  abstract = {Domesticated populations of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) probably have been selected for high growth rates and large body size, which may have resulted in reduced sprint swimming performance. We hypothesized that more domesticated populations of rainbow trout would have higher growth rates and larger body size, but slower swim speed, relative to semiwild populations. We tested this hypothesis by measuring body mass, body length, and sprint swim speed multiple times over 92 days in progeny from crosses between males from three clonal lines and an outbred female. We found significantly higher body masses and significantly slower swim speeds in the highly domesticated Arlee and Hot Creek progeny groups compared with the semiwild Swanson hybrid progeny group, supporting our hypothesis. Growth rates also differed significantly among groups, but at the ages measured, the Swanson hybrid progeny had an intermediate growth rate. However, given the differences in body mass, either growth rates were higher in the more domesticated progeny groups at young unmeasured ages and (or) they hatched at a significantly larger body mass than the semiwild Swanson hybrid.

Here, we use underwater visual-census data and nitrogen stable isotope analysis to test if coral reef fish communities (i) are size structured and (ii) follow metabolic scaling rules. After examining individuals from over 160 species spanning four orders of magnitude in body size, we show that abundance scaled negatively with body size and, as predicted, individuals sharing energy through predation (carnivorous fishes) scaled more steeply than those individuals sharing a common energy source (herbivorous fishes). Estimated size spectra were, however, shallower than predicted by metabolic theory. Trophic position scaled positively with body size across species and across individuals, providing novel evidence of size structuring in a diverse tropical food web. Size-based approaches hold great promise for integrating the complexities of food webs into simple quantitative measures, thus providing new insights into the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Fishing pressure on coral reef ecosystems has been frequently linked to reductions of large fishes and reef fish biomass. Associated impacts on overall community structure are, however, less clear. In size-structured aquatic ecosystems, fishing impacts are commonly quantified using size spectra, which describe the distribution of individual body sizes within a community. We examined the size spectra and biomass of coral reef fish communities at 38 USaffiliated Pacific islands that ranged in human presence from near pristine to human population centers. Size spectra `steepened' steadily with increasing human population and proximity to market due to a reduction in the relative biomass of large fishes and an increase in the dominance of small fishes. Reef fish biomass was substantially lower on inhabited islands than uninhabited ones, even at inhabited islands with the lowest levels of human presence. We found that on populated islands size spectra exponents decreased (analogous to size spectra steepening) linearly with declining biomass, whereas on uninhabited islands there was no relationship. Size spectra were steeper in regions of low sea surface temperature but were insensitive to variation in other environmental and geomorphic covariates. In contrast, reef fish biomass was highly sensitive to oceanographic conditions, being influenced by both oceanic productivity and sea surface temperature. Our results suggest that community size structure may be a more robust indicator than fish biomass to increasing human presence and that size spectra are reliable indicators of exploitation impacts across regions of different fish community compositions, environmental drivers, and fisheries types. Sizebased approaches that link directly to functional properties of fish communities, and are relatively insensitive to abiotic variation across biogeographic regions, offer great potential for developing our understanding of fishing impacts in coral reef ecosystems.},

Despite the ubiquity of small clearings in fragmented Amazonian landscapes, most fragmentation research has focused on the effects of large-scale deforestation, leading to a poor understanding of the impacts of smaller barriers on Amazonian vertebrates. We capitalized on the periodical re-isolation of experimental forest fragments at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project in the Central Amazon as a before-after-control-impact experiment to investigate the short-term effects of small clearings on bat assemblages. Over the course of three years we sampled six control sites in continuous forest, the interiors and edges of eight forest fragments as well as eight sites in the surrounding matrix. Sampling took place both before and after the experimental manipulation (clearing of a 100 m wide strip of regrowth around each fragment), resulting in \$4000 bat captures. Species were classified as old-growth specialists and habitat generalists according to their habitat affinities and a joint species distribution modeling framework was used to investigate the effect of fragment re-isolation on species occupancy. Following fragment re-isolation, species richness declined in all habitats other than fragment edges and, although responses were idiosyncratic, this decline was more pronounced for forest specialist than for generalist species. Additionally, fragment re-isolation led to a reduction in the similarity between assemblages in modified habitats (fragment interiors, edges and matrix) and continuous forest. Sampling of controls in continuous forest both prior to and after reisolation revealed that much of the variation in bat species occupancy between sampling periods did not arise from fragment re-isolation but rather reflected natural spatiotemporal variability. This emphasizes the need to sample experimental controls both before and after experimental manipulation and suggests caution in the interpretation of results from studies in which the effects of habitat transformations are assessed based solely on data collected using space-for-time substitution approaches.},

  abstract = {Maryland's recently created oyster restored reefs provide us with a unique opportunity to observe the abundance and species composition of macrofauna assemblages on unexploited reefs with high concentrations of mature oysters and undisturbed reef architecture. They might thus be used to better understand the magnitude of losses to reef dwelling macrofauna communities, and the associated loss of ecological functions resulting from reef destruction. We sampled reef macrofaunal assemblages on restored plots at four restored oyster reefs and adjacent non-restored plots located outside restored boundaries. We then compared the effects of study site location, and habitat quality (restored versus non-restored) on macrofaunal density using thirteen response variables. Density of macrofauna was an order of magnitude higher on restored reefs, epifaunal density was more than twice as high on restored reefs and sessile macrofaunal density was two orders of magnitude higher on restored reefs. Three out of the five dominant taxonomic groups were much more abundant on restored plots. Mean amphipod density was 20 times higher on restored plots and densities of xanthid crabs and demersal fish were both four times greater on restored plots. Two out of four functional feeding groups: suspension feeders and carnivore/omnivores, were more abundant on restored plots. Since reef macrofauna include many important fish prey species, oyster reef restoration may have the potential to augment fish production by increasing fish prey densities and fish foraging efficiency.},

The significant growth in global aquaculture since the middle of the 20th century has been dubbed by the Blue Revolution. However, it is not the first Blue Revolution to take place in human history. While historically classified as low-ranking, seasonal, or starvation resources in the archaeological discourse, marine foods were vital resources that ancient communities developed and exploited using a vast array of strategies. Among these aquatic strategies was aquaculture. This first Blue Revolution was initiated during the Early Holocene, some 8,000 years ago in China, with archaeologists now documenting aquaculture across the globe. This review considers the commonalities between ancient aquacultural systems including evidence of ecosystem engineering and the development of domesticated landscapes as production systems. People of the past constructed agroecosystems to not only enhance and diversify aquatic resources, but to control the reliability of key subsistence foods and to meet the demands of ritual practice and conspicuous social stratification. These aquaculture systems were maintained for centuries, if not millennia. Worldwide research conducted on ancient aquaculture can provide critical insights into developing more ecologically sustainable, resilient, and diverse marine production systems for coastal communities today, thus, achieving industry sustainability and limiting negative environmental impacts to the world's shorelines and overexploited fisheries.},

Studies that have not reported improvements in physical habitat often found that watershed processes (e.g., sediment, hydrology, water quality) had not been addressed.

  abstract = {Understanding spatial physical habitat selection driven by competition and/or predator\textendash prey interactions of mobile marine species is a fundamental goal of spatial ecology. However, spatial counts or density data for highly mobile animals often (1) include excess zeros, (2) have spatial correlation, and (3) have highly nonlinear relationships with physical habitat variables, which results in the need for complex joint spatial models. In this paper, we test the use of Bayesian hierarchical hurdle and zero-\- inflated joint models with integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA), to fit complex joint models to spatial patterns of eight mobile marine species (grey seal, harbor seal, harbor porpoise, common guillemot, black-\-legged kittiwake, northern gannet, herring, and sandeels). For each joint model, we specified nonlinear smoothed effect of physical habitat covariates and selected either competing species or predator\textendash prey interactions. Out of a range of six ecologically important physical and biologic variables that are predicted to change with climate change and large-\-scale energy extraction, we identified the most important habitat variables for each species and present the relationships between these bio/physical variables and species distributions. In particular, we found that net primary production played a significant role in determining habitat preferences of all the selected mobile marine species. We have shown that the INLA method is well-\-suited for modeling spatially correlated data with excessive zeros and is an efficient approach to fit complex joint spatial models with nonlinear effects of covariates. Our approach has demonstrated its ability to define joint habitat selection for both competing and prey\textendash predator species that can be relevant to numerous issues in the management and conservation of mobile \-marine species.},

  abstract = {Immunostimulants are valuable for the control of fish diseases and may be useful in fish culture. The immunostimulatory effects of glucan, chitin, lactoferrin and levamisole for fish and shrimp have been reported. Nutritional factors such as Vitamins B and C, growth hormone and prolactin have also been reported to be immunostimulators. These immunostimulants mainly facilitate the function of phagocytic cells and increase their bactericidal activities. Several immunostimulants also stimulate the natural killer cells, complement, lysozyme and antibody responses of fish. The activation of these immunological functions is associated with increased protection against infectious disease. Resistance to bacterial pathogens such as Vibrio anguillarum, V. salmonicida, Aeromonas salmonicida, Yersinia rukeri and Streptococcus spp. and to parasitic infections such as white spot disease can be increased by administration of immunostimulants, but not to intracellular pathogens such as Renibacterium salmoninarum and Pasteurella piscicida. The most effective method of administration of immunostimulants to fish is by injection. Oral and immersion methods have also been reported, but the efficacy of these methods decreases with long-term administration. Overdoses of several immunostimulants induce immunosuppression in fish. The side effects of immunostimulants have not been well-studied. Growthpromoting activity has been noted in fish or shrimp treated with glucan or lactoferrin. Immunostimulants can overcome immune suppression by sex hormones. Thus, the influence of immunostimulants in mature fish should be studied. In conclusion, immunostimulants can reduce the losses caused by disease in aquaculture; however, they may not be effective against all diseases. For the effective use of immunostimulants, the timing, dosages, method of administration and the physiological condition of fish need to be taken into consideration. q 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

On the Northwest Coast of North America, Indigenous peoples have sustained a diversity of fisheries through management innovations including designated access rights, harvest restrictions, and enhancement strategies. To elucidate how clam gardens, intertidal rock-walled terraces constructed by people in the Late Holocene, increased bivalve production, we quantified environmental variables and transplanted clams (Leukoma staminea) in present-day clam gardens and non-walled control beaches on the coast of western Canada. We found that higher bivalve biomass and densities in clam gardens could be attributed to the effect of terracing on ambient temperature and elevated sediment carbonate associated with crushed shell. These same variables drove detectable differences in transplanted clam growth rates. This study illuminates ecological mechanisms underlying this ancient innovation that could be used to enhance food security and confer resilience to impending oceanic changes.},

The distribution of these opportunistic worms is likely related to organic matter accumulation on the seafloor, and this species may have a role in remediation processes. To better understand the functional role of O. cyclops at aquaculture sites, it is important to know what they feed upon. Here, stable isotope analyses (d13C, d15N and d34S) and trace element analyses were performed on dorvilleids and their potential food sources at three aquaculture sites. Stable isotope analyses revealed spatial and temporal variation in the isotopic carbon signature of O. cyclops, highlighting possible differences in the food sources of individual dorvilleids within and between sites. The isotopic composition of dorvilleids was closest to that of fish pellets; the presence of abundant lipid droplets in gut epithelial cells of O. cyclops suggests the assimilation of fish pellet-derived lipids. Trace element analysis indicated that O. cyclops does not concentrate the aquaculture tracers Zn or Cu to a large extent. However, concentrations of sulphur were high in O. cyclops compared with other sources. Taken together, results show that O. cyclops most likely consume both fish pellets and flocculent matter-associated bacteria. As such, they are involved in sulphur cycling and fish pellet degradation at aquaculture sites.},

  abstract = {The timing and sequence of events underlying the origin and early evolution of vertebrates remains poorly understood. The palaeontological evidence should shed light on these issues, but difficulties in interpretation of the non-biomineralized fossil record make this problematic. Here we present an experimental analysis of decay of vertebrate characters based on the extant jawless vertebrates (               Lampetra               and               Myxine               ). This provides a framework for the interpretation of the anatomy of soft-bodied fossil vertebrates and putative cyclostomes, and a context for reading the fossil record of non-biomineralized vertebrate characters. Decay results in transformation and non-random loss of characters. In both lamprey and hagfish, different types of cartilage decay at different rates, resulting in taphonomic bias towards loss of `soft' cartilages containing vertebrate-specific Col2{$\alpha$}1 extracellular matrix proteins; phylogenetically informative soft-tissue characters decay before more plesiomorphic characters. As such, synapomorphic decay bias, previously recognized in early chordates, is more pervasive, and needs to be taken into account when interpreting the anatomy of any non-biomineralized fossil vertebrate, such as               Haikouichthys               ,               Mayomyzon               and               Hardistiella               .},

Analyses showed that 48.9\% of publications misinterpreted the conclusions of cited sources, with a bias towards claiming jellyfish populations are increasing, with a single review having the most influence on the network. Collectively, these disparities resulted in a network based on unsubstantiated statements and citation threads.

  abstract = {The physical environment in Patricia Bay of Saanich Inlet, British Columbia, is characterized. Turbulence and internal waves were measured over September 2010 using a moored Acoustic Doppler velocimeter and Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler, while diel vertical migration of zooplankton was recorded with an echosounder to test for possible biological generation of turbulence. The average turbulent dissipation rate {$\langle\epsilon\rangle$} was O(10 \`A 8 W kg \`A 1) with the corresponding diapycnal eddy diffusivity K of \$ 5\^A 10 \`A 6 m2 s \`A 1. Barotropic velocities responded to forcing outside Saanich Inlet in the Strait of Georgia and Haro Strait. Subtidal baroclinic velocities were southward at the surface and northward at mid-depth during spring tides, the reverse during neaps. Mode-2 M4 frequency in cross-inlet velocity u was more energetic than any mode-1 diurnal or semidiurnal frequencies in both u and v, which may be a signature of cross-inlet seiches. Spectral energy levels of baroclinic velocities and shear were weakly correlated with {$\epsilon$}. No relation was found between turbulent events and diel vertical migration.},

Salmon resources have been aided and harmed by technology, and managers must carefully assess how current and future technologies will be used to manage salmon. Effective managers must be knowledgeable of fishery science and human values. The science in fishery management is the objective, logical, and systematic method of obtaining reliable knowledge about fishery resources. The art in fishery management involves our values, that is, what we judge to be good, desirable, and important in the long run. A rational management plan is a selective embodiment of the values of the manager or of the organization or society that the manager represents. More surveys are needed to assess the values of the public toward salmon resources. Several potentially desirable directions are discussed for future salmon management in the Pacific Northwest.},

  abstract = {Identifying how past human actions have influenced their environment is essential for understanding the ecological factors that structure contemporary ecosystems. Intertidal resource use by Indigenous Peoples for thousands of years has led to habitation sites containing vast shell midden deposits and facilitating long-term impacts on soil chemistry and drainage. Here we examine how these shell middens have impacted various forest metrics, such as species diversity, community composition, canopy height, and regeneration recruitment to determine if forests on habitation sites differ from the surrounding matrix. We surveyed known habitation sites with archeological evidence indicating past year-round human occupation, within the Hakai L\'uxvb\'al\'is Conservancy on Calvert and Hecate Islands within the Great Bear Rainforest along British Columbia's Central Coast. Our results demonstrate that habitation sites exhibit lower tree species richness, less relative species abundances, as such, displayed lower Shannon diversity and inverse Simpson values. The composition of tree communities on habitation sites was statistically different, with western hemlock and western redcedar densities increasing on non-habitation sites. Conversely, regeneration diversity at habitation sites was more even and exhibited elevated Shannon diversity and inverse Simpson values. The community composition of regeneration was more consistent among habitation and non-habitation sites; however, western redcedar, western hemlock and Sitka spruce were more abundant at habitation sites. For all tree species, maximum height was higher within the habitation sites; however, this trend was the most notable in western redcedar and Sitka spruce, which increased by an average of 4.8 m relative to nonhabitation sites. Collectively, our findings suggest that long-term habitation alters forest community compositions. The landscape alterations within habitation sites promote conditions needed to support diverse, even, and abundant regeneration communities and consequently increase the height of the dominant coastal tree species. Thus, our results offer evidence that long-term influence by Indigenous communities have a persistent influence on coastal forests.},

Regression analysis was used to illustrate interspecific variation in ontogenetic patterns of prey size use, gape allometries, and ratio-based trophic niche breadths. Sizebased feeding strategies were assessed through comparison of frequency distributions of relative prey sizes eaten and were related to general predator feeding tactics and gape morphology. The results demonstrated that the range of prey sizes eaten expanded with increasing predator body size for each of the marine predators examined, leading to asymmetric predator size - prey size distributions. Absolute maximum prey size and slopes of maximum prey size versus predator size varied widely among predator taxa. Distinct size-based feeding strategies were evident, as diets of some predators were dominated by prey that were 10 to 20\% of predator size, whereas other predators frequently consumed prey {$>$} 50\% of predator size. Gape sizes and allometric relationships with body size were also diverse among predators and often were closely associated with maximum prey sizes. Ratio-based trophic-niche breadths generally did not expand with predator ontogeny and tended to narrow for the largest predators, which may be common for animal taxa.},

  abstract = {Bivalve shellfish aquaculture provides many benefits to society, beyond their traditional market value. This study collates the evidence available on the provisioning, regulating and cultural ecosystem services provided by the bivalve species commonly used in aquaculture. For the first time, it synthesises this evidence to provide a global assessment of the potential market and non-market economic value of bivalve aquaculture. Bivalves are filter feeders, filtering water and particulates, creating substrates which provide habitat to act as nursery grounds for other species. Goods from provisioning services include meat, worth an estimated \$23.9 billion as well as, pearls, shell and poultry grit, with oyster shell being the most important, with a global potential worth of \$5.2 billion. The most important regulating services are nutrient remediation. Cultivated bivalves remove 49,000 tonnes of nitrogen and 6,000 tonnes of phosphorus, worth a potential \$1.20 billion. Currently, there is little evidence on the cultural services per year of bivalve aquaculture, but we argue that these cultural values are broad ranging, although difficult to quantify. Our assessment indicates that the global, non-food bivalve aquaculture services are worth \$6.47 billion (\$2.95 billion\textendash 9.99 billion) per annum. However, this is likely to be an underestimate of the true value of bivalve aquaculture as there are significant gaps in evidence of the value for a number of key services. The analysis presented here can be used to indicate the likely scale of payments for ecosystem services provided by bivalve aquaculture, prior to more detailed assessments.},

The theory synthesizes top-down, ecosystem-level and bottom-up, organism-level approaches to ecological energetics and material cycles. The theory predicts a very simple straight-line relationship between residence time of carbon molecules and the ratio of whole-ecosystem biomass to primary productivity. This and additional predictions for total throughfow and recycling are supported by numerical models and data from real ecosystems. The theory provides a powerful way to understand the roles of organisms in ecosystem processes at scales from local habitats to the biosphere. Such an understanding is important for addressing the impacts of human-caused changes in climate, land use, and biodiversity.           ,                             Understanding the effects of individual organisms on material cycles and energy fluxes within ecosystems is central to predicting the impacts of human-caused changes on climate, land use, and biodiversity. Here we present a theory that integrates metabolic (organism-based bottom-up) and systems (ecosystem-based top-down) approaches to characterize how the metabolism of individuals affects the flows and stores of materials and energy in ecosystems. The theory predicts how the average residence time of carbon molecules, total system throughflow (TST), and amount of recycling vary with the body size and temperature of the organisms and with trophic organization. We evaluate the theory by comparing theoretical predictions with outputs of numerical models designed to simulate diverse ecosystem types and with empirical data for real ecosystems. Although residence times within different ecosystems vary by orders of magnitude\textemdash from weeks in warm pelagic oceans with minute phytoplankton producers to centuries in cold forests with large tree producers\textemdash as predicted, all ecosystems fall along a single line: residence time increases linearly with slope = 1.0 with the ratio of whole-ecosystem biomass to primary productivity (               B/P               ). TST was affected predominantly by primary productivity and recycling by the transfer of energy from microbial decomposers to animal consumers. The theory provides a robust basis for estimating the flux and storage of energy, carbon, and other materials in terrestrial, marine, and freshwater ecosystems and for quantifying the roles of different kinds of organisms and environments at scales from local ecosystems to the biosphere.},

However, studies have frequently reported negative or nonsignificant relationships. In a vast majority of them, environmental heterogeneity was defined along a gradient of increasing randomness, toward complete disorder. A new conceptual framework could help to reconcile the array of observed relationships. Using an extensive literature review, we test a conceptual framework proposing that the direction of environmental-heterogeneity-biodiversity relationships is contingent on the level of human footprint to which an ecosystem is subjected (the anthropocline). The results reveal that highly modified and seminatural ecosystems are characterized by a dominance of positive and negative EH-BD relationships, respectively, whereas natural ecosystems show mixed responses. Out of this novel framework arises the revised perspective that natural ecosystems are typified, not by maximal or minimal, but by intermediate levels of environmental heterogeneity.

Intra-population variability in resource use may occur across hierarchical levels of population structure from individuals to subpopulations. Understanding how levels of population organization contribute to population niche width is critical to ecology and evolution. Here we describe a hierarchical stable isotope mixing model that can simultaneously estimate both the prey composition of a consumer diet and the diet variability among individuals and across levels of population organization. By explicitly estimating variance components for multiple scales, the model can deconstruct the niche width of a consumer population into relevant levels of population structure. We apply this new approach to stable isotope data from a population of gray wolves from coastal British Columbia, and show support for extensive intra-population niche variability among individuals, social groups, and geographically isolated subpopulations. The analytic method we describe improves mixing models by accounting for diet variability, and improves isotope niche width analysis by quantitatively assessing the contribution of levels of organization to the niche width of a population.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an ecosystem modelling approach aimed at improving shellfish aquaculture management by explicitly considering natural benthic biodiversity. This methodology uses a combination of benthic field survey data, sediment and bathymetric mapping, physiological models and dynamic ecosystem modelling. The Wild species Integration for Shellfish Ecoaquaculture (WISE) approach helps to understand the baseline food requirements for maintaining natural benthic biodiversity of suspension-feeding organisms, thus informing managers on potential upper thresholds for shellfish aquaculture. WISE was tested in four coastal systems in Europe and China, including bays, estuaries and sea loughs with widely differing aquaculture activities. In the European systems, where the aquaculture industry is developing, species diversity and abundance are much higher and suspensionfeeding wild species play an important role in the consumption of food resources. Densities of wild individuals were estimated to be 13 ind m-2 in Sanggou Bay (total: 2 \texttimes{} 109), 33 ind m-2 in Xiangshan Gang (total: 122 \texttimes{} 109), 95 ind m-2 in Carlingford Lough (total: 4.62 \texttimes{} 109) and 175 ind m-2 in Loch Creran (total: 2.62 \texttimes{} 109). Total clearance rates by wild populations were calculated as 5\% of the total volume d-1 in Sanggou Bay (75 \texttimes{} 106 m3 d-1), 11\% d-1 in Xiangshan Gang (434 \texttimes{} 106 m3 d-1), 40\% d-1 in Loch Creran (93 \textendash{} 99 \texttimes{} 106 m3 d-1) and 45\% d-1 in Carlingford Lough (170\textendash 250 \texttimes{} 106 m3 d-1). In relative terms, wild populations play a more important role than cultivated shellfish in clearing suspended particles from the European systems due to the much lower aquaculture activity. 56\% and 76\% of total primary production in Loch Creran and Carlingford Lough, respectively, are consumed annually by wild organisms, while less than 50\% is consumed in Chinese systems (45\% in Sanggou Bay and 2.9\% in Xiangshan Gang). Integration of the WISE approach within broader ecological modelling illustrates some of the trade-offs between commercial aquaculture and the conservation of biodiversity, showing that rates of and capacities for shellfish culture are reduced when both wild and cultured suspension-feeding species are considered in relation to the available seston. When food resources are partitioned between wild and cultivated species, there is a decrease in individual length and weight (9 to 22\% reduction in shell length and 24 to 52\% reduction in total fresh weight for the Pacific oyster; reductions of 6\% in length and 20\% in weight for blue mussel; reductions of 4\% in length and 13\% in individual weight for bivalves in Xiangshan Gang), resulting in a lower aquaculture production (e.g. for Pacific oyster, a reduction of 12.5\% in Carlingford Lough, 34\% in Loch Creran and of 9\% for bivalves in Xiangshan Gang).},

  abstract = {Food insecurity is a significant public health problem for Indigenous peoples in Canada. A comprehensive literature review is needed to organize the evidence according to the 4 pillars of food security (i.e., availability, access, utilization, and stability) and identify gaps in the published literature on this topic. Therefore, in this scoping review we aimed to summarize the published research discussing any of the 4 pillars of food security among Indigenous peoples in Canada. We conducted a literature search of the following databases: Ovid Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science (Web of Knowledge), and CINAHL, as well as the Indigenous Studies Portal (up to June 19, 2021). Population-based studies of any design were included, except for review-style articles. Articles published in languages other than English were also excluded. Of the 4687 studies identified by the database searches, 91 met our inclusion criteria. Evidence from these studies indicates that all dimensions of food security among Indigenous peoples in Canada have been impacted. Lack of availability of both traditional and market foods is highlighted among Inuit and First Nation communities. Economic disadvantages, high food prices, and lack of access to transportation are major factors affecting the accessibility pillar of food security. Major factors affecting the utilization pillar of food security are the loss of traditional knowledge and skills, lack of knowledge on market foods, low quality of market foods, and food safety issues. Climate change has affected all 4 pillars of food security among Indigenous peoples. These findings suggest that resolving food insecurity issues among Indigenous peoples in Canada, especially those living in remote communities, requires a culturally specific integrated approach targeting food availability, food cost, food knowledge, food safety, and food quality.,  Statement of Significance: This article is, to our knowledge, the first scoping review in the literature that was performed with the aim of summarizing the published research discussing any of the 4 pillars of food security among Indigenous peoples in Canada.},

  abstract = {In Barkley Sound, British Columbia, Canada, the wide-bladed red alga Mazzaella splendens occurs intertidally at low to intermediate wave exposure sites but not at adjacent high wave exposure intertidal sites that are occupied by the narrow-bladed sister species Mazzaella linearis. This study used morphological and biomechanical characteristics of both species to determine whether or not drag and acceleration forces could prevent blades of M. splendens from surviving at high exposure sites and hence account, in part, for their distributions For each species, these hydrodynamic forces were calculated for gametophyte and sporophyte phases and, when possible, short and long thalli. The most frequent break location when thalli were pulled by a spring-scale was the junction between the stipe and holdfast. The following predictions were made by a model that compared hydrodynamic forces which a blade would experience to the measured force required to break the stipe/holdfast junction: (1) long blades of M. splendens should not occur at high wave exposure sites, (2) within the range of wave exposure occupied by M. splendens, sporophytes should be more abundant than gametophytes when and where wave exposure is greatest and (3)long blades of M linearis are predicted to occur at high wave exposure sites. All 3 of these predictions agree with other studies of natural populations. Two predictions do not agree with field observations: (1)long M. linearis gametophytes are predicted to have greater survivorship at higher water velocities than long sporophytes but, in natural populations, sporophytes are actually more abundant when wave action is greater and (2) short blades of M. splendens are predicted to survive very high water velocities but, in reality, are absent from high wave exposure sites in Barkley Sound. The latter contradlct\textasciitilde onsuggests that recruitment of M. splendens at high wave exposure sltes is prevented at a life history stage prior to the development of short blades.},

  abstract = {The theoretical and practical aspects of building of joint species-distribution models, a modern tool for the analysis of ecological communities, are considered. It is shown that it is inappropriate to use the MaxEnt method or other methods based on the concept of ``pseudo-absence'' points when the observational data are quantitative indicators of the population density (in particular, the abundance of species in hydrobiological studies). Contemporary multidimensional models of the joint distribution of communities should include a set of parameters that assess the impact of the following groups of fixed and random factors on the species occurrence: (a) the covariates and categorical variables describing the environmental conditions and characteristics of biotopes, (b) the main indicators characterizing each species and the phylogenetic structure of communities, (c) the functions of spatial autocorrelation of the data at observation points, (d) the residual (i.e., not caused by external factors) associativity of species. Analysis of the published data and practical examples of implementation showed that the mentioned requirements, in general, are satisfied by the methodological platform and the R package Hierarchical Modeling of Species Communities (HMSC). They form the basis for the construction of multidimensional hierarchical generalized linear models with mixed parameters estimated by Bayesian procedure. The main concepts and blocks of the HMSC platform are described, and the results of models based on the authors' data and long-term hydrobiological studies of benthic communities in 132 small and medium-sized rivers in the middle and lower Volga basin are discussed. The parameters of a set of one-dimensional candidate models for the abundance distribution of the subfamily Prodiamesinae (Diptera, Chironomidae) are analyzed, and a map of its forecast range within the region is constructed. To illustrate the multidimensional case, a model of the joint spatial distribution of 31 species of chironomids is constructed and its coefficients are analyzed. A residual correlation graph of statistically significant interspecies interactions has been built. It is concluded that the HMSC method and software package can be effectively used to solve fundamental problems of communities' ecology: the ways in which the areas of individual populations, the structure of their communities, and the nature of interspecific interactions depend the on environmental conditions and methods to predict future trends of these processes in response to global changes.},

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the synergistic relationship of perceived teacher autonomy support and the provision of structure in the prediction of self-regulated learning. Sample and method. Students (N {$\frac{1}{4}$} 526) completed questionnaires assessing perceived autonomy support, structure, and self-regulated learning. Results. First, autonomy support and structure were found to be positively correlated, suggesting that the support of student autonomy generally goes hand in hand with the provision of structure and order in the classroom. Second, moderated regression analyses indicated that structure but not autonomy support yielded a main effect on self-regulated learning, although this main effect was qualified by a structure by autonomy support interaction. Conclusion. The interaction suggests that structure was associated with more selfregulated learning under conditions of moderate and high autonomy support only. Therefore, when teachers want their students to evaluate themselves, to plan their study activities, and to think about themselves as learners, the teachers are encouraged to provide help, instructions, and expectations in an autonomy-supportive way.},

  abstract = {Biological systems, at all scales of organisation from nucleic acids to ecosystems, are inherently complex and variable. Biologists therefore use statistical analyses to detect signal among this systemic noise. Statistical models infer trends, find functional relationships and detect differences that exist among groups or are caused by experimental manipulations. They also use statistical relationships to help predict uncertain futures. All branches of the biological sciences now embrace the possibilities of mixed-effects modelling and its flexible toolkit for partitioning noise and signal. The mixed-effects model is not, however, a panacea for poor experimental design, and should be used with caution when inferring or deducing the importance of both fixed and random effects. Here we describe a selection of the perils and pitfalls that are widespread in the biological literature, but can be avoided by careful reflection, modelling and model-checking. We focus on situations where incautious modelling risks exposure to these pitfalls and the drawing of incorrect conclusions. Our stance is that statements of significance, information content or credibility all have their place in biological research, as long as these statements are cautious and well-informed by checks on the validity of assumptions. Our intention is to reveal potential perils and pitfalls in mixed model estimation so that researchers can use these powerful approaches with greater awareness and confidence. Our examples are ecological, but translate easily to all branches of biology.},

  abstract = {This essay explores shifting scientific understandings of fish and the evolution of fisheries science, and it grapples with colonialism as a system of power. We trace the rise of fisheries science to a time when Western nation-states were industrializing fishing fleets and competing for access to distant fishing grounds. A theory of fishing called ``maximum sustainable yield'' (MSY) that understands fish species in aggregate was espoused. Although alternatives to MSY have been developed, decision-making continues to be informed by statistical models developed within fisheries science. A challenge for structured management systems now rests in attending to different systems of knowledge and addressing local objectives, values, and circumstances. To deepen and illustrate key points, we examine Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) and the expansion of commercial herring fisheries and state-led management in British Columbia, Canada. A feedback between colonialism and fisheries science is evident: colonialism generated the initial conditions for expansion and has been reinforced through the implementation of approaches and tools from fisheries science that define and quantify conservation in particular ways. Some features may be unique to the herring illustration, but important aspects of the feedback are more broadly generalizable. We propose three interconnected goals: (a) transform the siloed institutions and practices of Western science, (b) reimagine and rebuild pathways between information (including diverse values and perspectives) and decision-making, and (c) devolve governance authority and broaden governance processes such that multiple ways of knowing share equal footing.},

Available data indicate a spectrum of influences on the ability of estuaries to sustain biota unrelated to the cultured species. Certain disturbances, such as adding gravel to mudflats and sandflats to enhance clam production, may subtly impact certain benthic and epibenthic invertebrates without changing the carrying capacity for estuarine-dependent taxa, such as juvenile Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus pp.). However, habitat shifts might alter the relative suitability for different salmon species. In contrast, acute disturbances that produce large-scale changes in community dominants, such as manipulation of burrowing shrimp or eelgrass with pesticides or mechanical harvesting and manipulation of oyster grounds, strongly influence the carrying capacity for many fish and macroinvertebrates. Ensuring that estuarine ecosystems are sustainable for the breadth of processes and resources requires a comprehensive assessment of both natural and anthropogenic disturbance regimes, landscape influences, and the effects of local management for particular species on other resources.},

However, compared with many other terrestrial and marine vegetated ecosystems, kelp forests have been critically understudied in many regions, leading to pressing knowledge gaps that hinder management and conservation efforts. We conducted a large-scale survey of understorey macroalgae within subtidal kelp forests dominated by Laminaria hyperborea at 12 sites, nested within 4 regions in the United Kingdom (UK). Regions spanned * 9\textdegree{} in latitude and encompassed a gradient in average sea surface temperature of * 2.5 \textdegree C. We employed a combination of traditional hand-harvesting of quadrat samples and a novel 3D photogrammetry technique to quantify crustose coralline algae. The structure of understorey macroalgal assemblages was highly variable but showed clear partitioning at the spatial scales of both regions and sites. At the regional-scale, we observed a general increase in richness, diversity and biomass from north to south, most likely due to biogeographical context, ocean climate and the structure and composition of overlying kelp canopies. Site level variation was most likely driven by concurrent variability in wave exposure and kelp canopy structure. Our study shows that understorey macroalgal assemblages represent a rich and abundant component of kelp forests in the northeast Atlantic, with high biodiversity value that warrant conservation measures. As these kelp forest ecosystems are structured by multiple physical and biological processes, current and predicted environmental change will likely alter the diversity and composition of understorey macroalgal assemblages.},

The paired nets were redeployed, and marked fish were randomly assigned to be stocked into the restricted or unrestricted net for 24 h; stocking densities (stratified into low, medium, and high) were species specific. Marked fish that were retained after 24 h were used to quantify escapement, whereas newly captured fish were used to estimate differences in mean CPUE and size structure. Mean CPUE of Black Bullheads Ameiurus melas, Black Crappies Pomoxis nigromaculatus, and Bluegills Lepomis macrochirus approximately doubled when restricted nets were used. Mean TL of Black Crappies was 31 mm greater (95\% confidence interval [CI] D 6\textendash 57 mm greater) and mean TL of Bluegills was 21 mm greater (95\% CI D 8\textendash 35 mm greater) in restricted nets than in unrestricted nets. Escapement from restricted nets was 4.4\% for Black Crappies and 10.3\% for Bluegills, whereas escapement from unrestricted nets was 71.7\% for Black Crappies and 58.4\% for Bluegills. We urge researchers to consider the influence of varying fyke-net throat configurations on calculated population metrics, and we recommend inclusion of the restricted throat feature in gear specifications for North American standard modified fyke nets.},

However, since such systems either do not leave tangible remains inthe archaeological record, and/or are hard todate, we know little about their development and use. Clam gardens, traditional mariculture features located within the intertidal zone along the Northwest Coast ofNorth America, are composed ofarock wall positioned atthe low tide mark and aflattened terrace on the landward side ofthe wall. Because these features are largely composed ofrock and sediment, and have complex formation histories, they can be difficult toage. On northern Quadra Island, British Columbia, we identify three variations inclam garden form, constructed indifferent geomorphological settings, each ofwhich require different sampling approaches toobtain ages on construction and ongoing use. To age the clam gardens, we consider radiocarbon dating ofinvertebrates that inhabit beach deposits (both pre- and post-garden construction), and the relationship of the gardens and clam samples tothe local sea level history and taphonomic processes. Within our study area, we find clam gardens have been inuse for 3500 years, likely corresponding toother social and ecological changes ofthe time. These data allow us toformulate guidelines on samples most suitable toconstrain the age ofinitial and on-going wall construction and use ofclam gardens, which can be extrapolated todating other ancient mariculture features inother regions. Such dating programs are the foundation for understanding the long-term development oftraditional marine management practices and how they are situated inbroader social-ecologicalsystems.},

Although most discussion of the topic relates to decreasing species abundances, there are several reasons to think that abundances of many species will increase in response to anthropogenic disturbance. For example, increases in abundances of certain species are predicted after the removal of predators, as exotic and invasive species become established, and as habitat generalists proliferate. Because generational amnesia about historic conditions could influence the setting of restoration targets, restoration ecologists should explicitly consider the shifting baseline syndrome in reference to increases in abundances from historic levels.},

An increase in available niche space, provision of refuges and opportunities for isolation and divergent adaptation are thought to enhance species coexistence, persistence and diversification. However, the extent and generality of positive heterogeneity\textendash richness relationships are still debated. Apart from widespread evidence supporting positive relationships, negative and hump-shaped relationships have also been reported. In a meta-analysis of 1148 data points from 192 studies worldwide, we examine the strength and direction of the relationship between spatial environmental heterogeneity and species richness of terrestrial plants and animals. We find that separate effects of heterogeneity in land cover, vegetation, climate, soil and topography are significantly positive, with vegetation and topographic heterogeneity showing particularly strong associations with species richness. The use of equal-area study units, spatial grain and spatial extent emerge as key factors influencing the strength of heterogeneity\textendash richness relationships, highlighting the pervasive influence of spatial scale in heterogeneity\textendash richness studies. We provide the first quantitative support for the generality of positive heterogeneity\textendash richness relationships across heterogeneity components, habitat types, taxa and spatial scales from landscape to global extents, and identify specific needs for future comparative heterogeneity\textendash richness research.},

As part of a pilot survey of 355 lakes in the northeastern U.S.A., we sampled zooplankton assemblages and evaluated candidate indicators for their components of variance. Indicators with high sensitivity for status estimation show strong lake-to-lake differences as defined by the ratio of the spatial component of variance divided by the remaining components. Sensitivity generally increased within spatial partitions of the larger Northeast region. Calanoid abundance indicators showed the highest sensitivity but only within the Adirondack Mountains and coastal/urban zone and had low sensitivity in region-wide estimates. Rotifer, cyclopoid copepod, and cladoceran abundances showed low sensitivity irrespective of subregions. Richness indicators also showed low sensitivity across subregions. We conclude that sensitivity can be increased for many zooplankton indicators with increased revisit sampling and with refinement of spatial boundaries. Our results also show a good correspondence within abundance indicators between first and second visits within a year. Hence, the single visit protocol of the sampling design provides a reasonable snapshot of the general structure of a lake's zooplankton assemblage.},

Here we introduce MixSIAR, an inclusive, rich, and flexible Bayesian tracer (e.g., stable isotope) mixing model framework implemented as an open-source R package. Using MixSIAR as a foundation, we provide guidance for the implementation of mixing model analyses. We begin by outlining the practical differences between mixture data error structure formulations and relate these error structures to common mixing model study designs in ecology. Because Bayesian mixing models afford the option to specify informative priors on source proportion contributions, we outline methods for establishing prior distributions and discuss the influence of prior specification on model outputs. We also discuss the options available for source data inputs (raw data versus summary statistics) and provide guidance for combining sources. We then describe a key advantage of MixSIAR over previous mixing model software\textemdash the ability to include fixed and random effects as covariates explaining variability in mixture proportions and calculate relative support for multiple models via information criteria. We present a case study of Alligator mississippiensis diet partitioning to demonstrate the power of this approach. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of limitations to mixing model applications. Through MixSIAR, we have consolidated the disparate array of mixing model tools into a single platform, diversified the set of available parameterizations, and provided developers a platform upon which to continue improving mixing model analyses in the future.},

  abstract = {Agriculture and biodiversity have often been regarded as separate concerns. Although biodiversity underpins much of modern agriculture, the development of contemporary production systems has resulted in extensive land conversion and concomitant biodiversity loss. In order to feed an ever growing population, innovative and acceptable ways of integrating biodiversity conservation and food production need to be identified. Maintaining diversity within agricultural systems is not a novel approach but one practiced by many smallholder farmers globally, in many different ways. The nutritional and livelihood benefits of diverse production systems are one way of achieving food security. Such systems are also more resilient to climate induced events or other shocks. Forests represent an important repository of food and other resources that can play a key role in contributing towards food security, especially if integrated into complex systems that are managed for multiple benefits.},

The convex hull area (TA) in a d13C\textendash d15N biplot has been used as a measure of isotopic niche width, but concerns exist over its dependence on sample size and associated difficulties in among-population comparisons. Recently a more robust method was proposed for estimating and comparing isotopic niche widths using standard ellipse areas (SEA), but this approach has yet to be tested with empirical stable isotope data. The two methods measure different kind of isotopic niche areas, but both are now widely used to characterise isotopic niche widths of populations. We used simulated data and an extensive empirical dataset from two fish populations to test the influence of sample size on the observed isotopic niche widths (TA and SEA). We resampled the original datasets to generate 5000 new samples for different numbers of observations from 5 to 80 to examine the statistical distributions of niche area estimates for increasing sample size. Our results illustrate how increasing sample size increased the observed TA; even sample sizes much higher than n = 30 did not improve the precision for the TA method. SEA was less sensitive to sample size, but the natural variation in our empirical fish d13C and d15N data still resulted in considerable uncertainty around the mean estimates of niche width, reducing the precision particularly with sample sizes n,30. These results confirm that the TA method is less appropriate for estimating population isotopic niche areas using small samples, especially when considerable population level isotope variation is expected. The results also indicate a need for caution when using SEA as a measure of trophic niche widths for consumers, particularly with low sample sizes and when the distribution and range for population isotope values are not known.},

Because sea otters are now extinct from much of this region and have not fully recolonized their former range (e.g. Haida Gwaii and most of northern BC) these data represent an important first step towards better understanding sea otter foraging ecology in BC. The isotopic data suggest a diet composed primarily of benthic invertebrates, with a very low reliance on epibenthic fish. There is very low isotopic and thus inter-individual dietary variability in Holocene BC sea otters during the late Holocene. Furthermore, zooarchaeological abundance data suggest that otters represented a widespread and significant focus of aboriginal hunting practices on the northern BC coast during the mid- to lateHolocene. The consistent reliance on a small number of low-trophic level prey and limited dietary variability in Holocene BC sea otters may reflect top-down impacts on otter populations by aboriginal peoples. As part of our assessment of sea otter diet, we review trophic discrimination factors (D13C and D15N) for bone collagen from published literature and find marked variability, with mean values of \th 3.7 \AE{} 1.6 for D13C (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 21) and \th 3.6 \AE{} 1.3 for D15N (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 15).},

They play an important role in nutrient cycling, energy capture and transfer, and provide biogenic coastal defence. Kelps also provide extensive substrata for colonising organisms, ameliorate conditions for understorey assemblages, and provide three-dimensional habitat structure for a vast array of marine plants and animals, including a number of commercially important species. Here, we review and synthesize existing knowledge on the functioning of kelp species as biogenic habitat providers. We examine biodiversity patterns associated with kelp holdfasts, stipes and blades, as well as the wider understorey habitat, and search for generality between kelp species and biogeographic regions. Environmental factors influencing biogenic habitat provision and the structure of associated assemblages are considered, as are current threats to kelpdominated ecosystems. Despite considerable variability between species and regions, kelps are key habitatforming species that support elevated levels of biodiversity, diverse and abundant assemblages and facilitate trophic linkages. Enhanced appreciation and better management of kelp forests are vital for ensuring sustainability of ecological goods and services derived from temperate marine ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Benthic indices are useful indicators of sediment condition, but many indices are difficult to employ because they require large calibration datasets. The AZTI's Marine Biotic Index (AMBI) requires minimal local calibration, but it was developed in Europe and the validity of its extension to distant regions is unclear. Here we compare its performance in Southern California's marine bays with that of the Benthic Response Index (BRI), a locally derived data-intensive index. AMBI was calibrated in four ways: (1) using the original AMBI species' classifications developed in Europe; (2) augmenting the original classifications with closely related taxa, following AMBI guidelines; (3) using local expertise to independently classify taxa; and (4) revision of the local expert classifications by European developers of the index. These approaches were applied to a 685 sample data set and assessed relative to the BRI by comparing samples' classification from best to worst and by evaluating the level of agreement in assigning samples into four condition categories. The AMBI was validated against environmental proxies of disturbance and expert judgement, using consensus agreement about sample condition developed by nine benthic ecologists. The first AMBI approach did not work well, as only 24\% of the 928 taxa were on the original AMBI species list, resulting in only 11\% of the samples meeting the required 20\% of classified individuals for AMBI application. The other approaches classified substantially more taxa, allowing application to 75\textendash 98\% of the samples. Both of these approaches were significantly correlated with the BRI, though the correlations were lower than between the AMBI runs. None of the AMBI approaches, though, compared well with either the BRI or the validation data when placing samples into perturbation categories, with the AMBI having a greater central tendency. AMBI categorized less than 5\% of the samples as reference compared to almost one-third of the samples by the experts or BRI, and substantially underestimating the number of severely affected samples. Species most responsible for disagreements between BRI and AMBI approaches were identified. Four modifications to enhance AMBI performance were identified: (1) incorporate local expertise in assigning ecological classifications, (2) use transformed abundance weighting to reduce the effect of dominant species, (3) calibrate the categorization scaling using expert judgement, and (4) use the AMBI in combination with other measures, such as the M-AMBI. The success of these modifications is specific to this study, but they are likely to enhance AMBI's performance worldwide.},

  abstract = {Marine ecosystems worldwide are under threat with many fish species and populations suffering from human overexploitation. This is greatly impacting global biodiversity, economy and human health. Intriguingly, marine fish are largely surveyed using selective and invasive methods, which are mostly limited to commercial species, and restricted to particular areas with favourable conditions. Furthermore, misidentification of species represents a major problem. Here, we investigate the potential of using metabarcoding of environmental DNA (eDNA) obtained directly from seawater samples to account for marine fish biodiversity. This eDNA approach has recently been used successfully in freshwater environments, but never in marine settings. We isolate eDNA from K-litre seawater samples collected in a temperate marine ecosystem in Denmark. Using next-generation DNA sequencing of PCR amplicons, we obtain eDNA from 15 different fish species, including both important consumption species, as well as species rarely or never recorded by conventional monitoring. We also detect eDNA from a rare vagrant species in the area; European pilchard (Sardina pilchardus). Additionally, we detect four bird species. Records in national databases confirmed the occurrence of all detected species. To investigate the efficiency of the eDNA approach, we compared its performance with 9 methods conventionally used in marine fish surveys. Promisingly, eDNA covered the fish diversity better than or equal to any of the applied conventional methods. Our study demonstrates that even small samples of seawater contain eDNA from a wide range of local fish species. Finally, in order to examine the potential dispersal of eDNA in oceans, we performed an experiment addressing eDNA degradation in seawater, which shows that even small (100-bp) eDNA fragments degrades beyond detectability within days. Although further studies are needed to validate the eDNA approach in varying environmental conditions, our findings provide a strong proof-ofconcept with great perspectives for future monitoring of marine biodiversity and resources.},

While such evidence has been marshalled for plant cultivation, we argue that similar cultivation techniques developed around salmon and other critical marine resources of which they had intimate knowledge, and that such interventions helped regularize supplies, ameliorate disruptions, accommodate shifts, and even reverse declines in species populations by recreating or strengthening conditions for sustaining species in dynamic ecological systems. The plants, fish, and wildlife of the region were resilient, and often pre-adapted to cyclic or stochastic disturbance regimes, but, like the aboriginal populations themselves, also vulnerable to environmental shocks and scarcities. We suggest that Northwest Coast indigenous people observed the effects of both gradual and rapid environmental change on key species over generations, and adjusted their behavior accordingly. The effects of human enhancement, human over-exploitation, or natural perturbations were often rapidly apprehended, allowing for feedback mechanisms that became integral to the technologies and social mechanisms for resource management. These practices are best conceptualized as cultivation techniques rather than restrictive conservation practices, designed to optimise resource supplies and harvest conditions, thus reducing risk and vulnerability and increasing social-ecological resilience.},

  abstract = {Fishing can drive changes in important phenotypic traits through plastic and evolutionary pathways. Size-\-selective harvest is a primary driver of such trait change, has received much attention in the literature and is now commonly considered in fisheries management. The potential for selection on behavioural traits has received less study, but mounting evidence suggests that aggression, foraging behaviour and linked traits can also be affected by fishing. An important phenomenon that has received much less attention is selection on reproductive phenology (i.e., the timing of breeding). The potential for this type of ``temporal selection'' is widespread because there is often substantial variability in reproductive phenology within fish populations, and fisheries management strategies or fishermen's behaviours can cause fishing effort to vary greatly over time. For example, seasonal closures may expose only early or late breeding individuals to harvest as observed in a range of marine and freshwater fisheries. Such selection may induce evolutionary responses in phenological traits, but can also have demographic impacts such as shortened breeding seasons and reduced phenotypic diversity. These changes can in turn influence productivity, reduce the efficacy of management, exacerbate ongoing climate-\-driven changes in phenology and reduce resilience to environmental change. In this essay, we describe how fisheries management can cause temporal variability in harvest, and describe the types of selection on temporal traits that can result. We then summarize the likely biological consequences of temporally selective fishing on populations and population complexes and conclude by identifying areas for future research.},

  abstract = {Shoreline armoring is prevalent worldwide and has resulted in substantial habitat alteration in heavily urbanized areas. The biological and physical processes associated with these shorelines have in many cases been compromised, which has led to a recent focus on how to design and implement projects to restore some of the lost or impaired functions, termed enhancement. We describe a multi-year effort testing whether an enhanced site has improved conditions in Seattle, WA, USA, along urban marine shorelines of Puget Sound. The Olympic Sculpture Park opened in January 2007 and included construction of two shallow-water features: a low-terrace habitat bench placed in front of an existing seawall, and a constructed pocket beach that replaced existing riprap. Riparian vegetation was also planted in the uplands replacing impervious surfaces and manicured lawn. We measured the functions of these sites by sampling both before and after enhancements (2005, 2007, and 2009), and comparing to adjacent armored shorelines. Although we are limited in our ability to make generalizations beyond this specific site due to only having one replicate of each shoreline type, the unique aspects of this urban enhancement make it useful as a case study that can apply to other urban systems. Fishes that are dependent on shallow water habitat were a main focus of sampling, specifically outmigrating juvenile salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) and larvae of other species. Terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates were also assessed, both as a metric for habitat quality and as a determinant of available prey resources for juvenile salmon. Physical features of the created habitats were monitored in post-enhancement years to measure their stability. Results showed that shoreline enhancements increased densities of larval fishes and juvenile salmon and measurements of juvenile salmon feeding behavior dependent on the year, and provided habitat for invertebrate assemblages that were different from armored shorelines and had high taxa richness. Physical resilience depended on both natural processes and human activities, demonstrating the need to incorporate anthropogenic use into the management of urban shorelines.},

Despite almost 90 years of widespread use of aluminum adjuvants, medical science's understanding about their mechanisms of action is still remarkably poor. There is also a concerning scarcity of data on toxicology and pharmacokinetics of these compounds. In spite of this, the notion that aluminum in vaccines is safe appears to be widely accepted. Experimental research, however, clearly shows that aluminum adjuvants have a potential to induce serious immunological disorders in humans. In particular, aluminum in adjuvant form carries a risk for autoimmunity, long-term brain inflammation and associated neurological complications and may thus have profound and widespread adverse health consequences. In our opinion, the possibility that vaccine benefits may have been overrated and the risk of potential adverse effects underestimated, has not been rigorously evaluated in the medical and scientific community. We hope that the present paper will provide a framework for a much needed and long overdue assessment of this highly contentious medical issue.},

We bring together paleoecological, archaeological, and modern clam records to explore the relationship between humans and butter clams (Saxidomus gigantea) throughout the Holocene in the northern Salish Sea of British Columbia, Canada. We compare butter clam size and growth patterns from different temporal, environmental, and cultural contexts spanning 11,500 y to present. Butter clam size and growth were restricted in early postglacial times but increased over the next few millennia. During the early-Late Holocene, humans took increasing advantage of robust clam populations and after 3.5 ka, began constructing clam gardens (intertidal rock-walled terraces). Environmental and cul- tural variables, including coarse substrate, stabilized sea surface temperature, and the presence of a clam garden wall, increased clam growth throughout the Holocene. Measurements of clams collected in active clam gardens and deposited in middens suggest that clam gardens as well as other mariculture activities enhanced clam production despite increased harvesting pressure. Since European contact, decline of traditional management practices and increases in industrial activities are associated with reduced clam size and growth similar to those of the early postglacial clams. Deeper-time baselines that more accurately represent clam population vari-ability and allow us to assess magnitudes of change throughout timeas well as the complex interactions among humans and clams areuseful for modern marine resource management.},

This is particularly the case over the last 6,000 years when intensified intertidal shellfish usage resulted in the accumulation of substantial shell middens. We show that soils at habitation sites are higher in calcium and phosphorous. Both of these are limiting factors in coastal temperate rainforests. Western redcedar (               Thuja plicata               ) trees growing on the middens were found to be taller, have higher wood calcium, greater radial growth and exhibit less top die-back.

  abstract = {Understanding how habitat complexity shapes fish communities is necessary to predict the consequences of future habitat change. On temperate rocky reefs, the presence and characteristics of canopy-forming kelps and the architectural complexity, or rugosity, of the underlying rocky substratum are foundational elements of habitat complexity. However, it is not yet clear how these factors shape the size structure of rocky-reef-associated fish communities. Here, we use biomass spectrum models to evaluate how fish community size structure in high-latitude rocky-reef kelp forests is shaped by substratum rugosity and the degree of closure and density of the kelp canopy. We found that the presence of a closed kelp canopy was associated with an average 75\% increase in overall fish biomass compared to open-canopy reefs. Furthermore, on the highestrugosity reefs, the biomass of small fishes (32-64 g) was 800\% higher than on the lowest-rugosity reefs, while large fish (1-2 kg) biomass was 60\% lower. Consequently, biomass was more evenly distributed across body-size classes on high-rugosity reefs. By decomposing the biomass spectrum into total biomass and mean individual body mass, we found that higher kelp stipe densities also tended to be associated with larger fishes, but this effect was outweighed by the tendency for more small-bodied fishes with increasing rugosity. This study demonstrates how size-based analyses can give new insights into the ecology of temperate reef communities, and may be useful for tracking changes in kelp-associated assemblages in the coming decades with the maturation of marine protected areas, the recovery of sea otter populations, and changing climate.},

  abstract = {Theory predicts that bottom-heavy biomass pyramids or `stacks' should predominate in real-world communities if trophic-level increases with body size (mean predator-to-prey mass ratio (PPMR) more than 1). However, recent research suggests that inverted biomass pyramids (IBPs) characterize relatively pristine reef fish communities. Here, we estimated the slope of a kelp forest fish community biomass spectrum from underwater visual surveys. The observed biomass spectrum slope is strongly positive, reflecting an IBP. This is incongruous with theory because this steep positive slope would only be expected if trophic position decreased with increasing body size (consumer-to-resource mass ratio, less than 1). We then used {$\delta$}               15               N signatures of fish muscle tissue to quantify the relationship between trophic position and body size and instead detected strong evidence for the opposite, with PPMR {$\approx$} 1650 (50\% credible interval 280\textendash 12 000). The natural history of kelp forest reef fishes suggests that this paradox could arise from energetic subsidies in the form of movement of mobile consumers across habitats, and from seasonally pulsed production inputs at small body sizes. There were four to five times more biomass at large body sizes (1\textendash 2 kg) than would be expected in a closed steady-state community providing a measure of the magnitude of subsidies.},

Examples are provided from various groups, most notably, the Secwepemc (Shuswap) Interior Salish and Kwakwaka'wakw and Nuu-Chah-Nulth peoples of the Northwest Coast, covering a range of features comprising TEKW: knowledge of ecological principles, such as succession and interrelatedness of all components of the environment; use of ecological indicators; adaptive strategies for monitoring, enhancing, and sustainably harvesting resources; effective systems of knowledge acquisition and transfer; respectful and interactive attitudes and philosophies; close identification with ancestral lands; and beliefs that recognize the power and spirituality of nature. These characteristics, taken in totality, have enabled many groups of aboriginal peoples to live sustainably within their local environments for many thousands of years. In order for TEKW to be incorporated appropriately into current ecosystem-based management strategies, the complete context of TEKW, including its philosophical bases, must be recognized and respected. A case study of ecological and cultural knowledge of the traditional root vegetables yellow avalanche lily (Erythronium grandiflorum) and balsamroot (Balsamorhiza sagittata) illustrates ways in which these components can be integrated.},

  abstract = {Lessons in conservation are often seen as resulting from cycles of overexploitation and subsequent depletion of resources, followed by catastrophic consequences of shortage and starvation, and finally, development of various strategies, including privatization of the commons, to conserve remaining resource stocks. While such scenarios have undoubtedly occurred on many occasions, we suggest that they are not the only means by which people develop conservation practices and concepts. There are other pathways leading to ecological understanding and conservation, which act at a range of scales and levels of complexity. These include: lessons from the past and from other places, perpetuated and strengthened through oral history and discourse; lessons from animals, learned through observation of migration and population cycles, predator effects, and social dynamics; monitoring resources and human effects on resources (positive and negative), building on experiences and expectations; observing changes in ecosystem cycles and natural disturbance events; trial and error experimentation and incremental modification of habitats and populations. Humans, we believe, are capable of building a sophisticated conservation ethic that transcends individual species and resources. A combination of conservation knowledge, practices, and beliefs can lead to increasingly greater sophistication of ecological understanding and the continued encoding of such knowledge in social institutions and worldview.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Knowledge and practices of indigenous peoples relating to local plants used for food, medicine, materials, and other purposes are threatened in many parts of the world. The reasons for declining knowledge and use of traditional resources are complex and multifaceted. We review a series of case examples of culturally valued food plants in British Columbia and identify a suite of interacting social and environmental factors that have resulted in decreased use of and dwindling cultural knowledge about these plants over the past 150 years. Reasons for this loss include compounding influences of changing knowledge systems owing to religious conversion and residential schools, loss of indigenous languages, loss of time and opportunity for traditional practices owing to participation in the wage economy, increasing urbanization of indigenous populations, loss of access to traditional resources, restriction of management practices for sustaining these resources, and most recently, forces of globalization and industrialization. Efforts to renew and restore traditional practices and relationships with plants and environments must recognize the cumulative effects of these factors and find ways to retain and reinforce the knowledge and practices still held by individuals and communities, to reverse some of the negative influences on cultural retention, and to develop new, relevant, and effective ways to revitalize languages, cultures, and ethnobotanical knowledge within contemporary contexts.},

Externally driven projects and policies can overwhelm communities' abilities to respond, severely impact in their resource base, and significantly eclipse traditional knowledge, practices and values. Such projects and policies can be devastating to small, Indigenous communities struggling to maintain their culture and economic independence in a changing world. While many examples of external impacts on small-scale resource use could be drawn upon for these communities, we illustrate this situation by examining the impact of fisheries management regimes on Indigenous coastal communities in British Columbia, Canada and Aotearoa New Zealand. We characterize the problem and identify key stressors involved. Within the context of Indigenous rights and Indigenous peoples' knowledge, perspectives and experience, we highlight the need to recognize this type of constraint on Indigenous Peoples' resource use and effective participation in resource management.},

  abstract = {The biotic community at a shelf-edge reef, which abruptly delineates a continuous fringing reef from the adjacent mesophotic reef off southwestern Puerto Rico, USA, was used to identify patterns of differential habitat use in reef fishes. Our study used multivariate analyses to identify groupings within the fish community associated with this area. These groups were suggestive of differential habitat use by the fish community, in particular with respect to the reefterrace vs slope locations. The benthic composition among these two location stratifications differed while remaining surprisingly consistent within each location strata (i.e., reef-terrace vs slope). The variability in both the fish and benthic communities was best explained in our model by the location stratifications within each site as opposed to the physical position of the site itself along the shelf edge. Food resources, structure (i.e., habitat complexity), or both may contribute to differential habitat use within the reeffish communities observed. A lesser division was apparent within the reef-terrace locations that grouped the western samples separately from the eastern. The results presented in the present study suggest that the fish communities along the shelf-edge reef adjacent to La Parguera, Puerto Rico, are divided by habitat type and location as determined by food and shelter availability. Here, we present an analysis whereby community structure can be identified at varying spatial scales within a single depth zone to inform managers prior to strategy implementation.},

Aquaculture practices encounter many challenges, and one of the most devastating problems is disease outbreaks caused by microbial pathogens. To control disease outbreaks, several chemotherapeutics and antibiotics were used indiscriminately, which in turn leads to residual problems in the surrounding environment affecting higher animals and also humans. Immunostimulants are considered as an alternative for antibiotics, which will boost the immune system of the cultured organism, thus effectively countering the assault of pathogens. The use of plant materials as immunostimulant will be an ecofriendly approach for the control of pathogens. The botanicals present in the plants have a key role in enhancing the fish immunity.

Selection represents deterministic fitness differences among species, drift represents stochastic changes in species abundance, speciation creates new species, and dispersal is the movement of organisms across space. All theoretical and conceptual models in community ecology can be understood with respect to their emphasis on these four processes. Empirical evidence exists for all of these processes and many of their interactions, with a predominance of studies on selection. Organizing the material of community ecology according to this framework can clarify the essential similarities and differences among the many conceptual and theoretical approaches to the discipline, and it can also allow for the articulation of a very general theory of community dynamics: species are added to communities via speciation and dispersal, and the relative abundances of these species are then shaped by drift and selection, as well as ongoing dispersal, to drive community dynamics.},

  abstract = {Significance             A major advance of the last 20 y at the interface of biological, environmental, and conservation sciences has been the demonstration that plant biodiversity positively influences ecosystem function. Linking these results to applied conservation efforts hinges on the assumption that biodiversity is actually declining at the local scale at which diversity\textendash function relationships are strongest. Our compilation and analysis of a global database of {$>$}16,000 repeat survey vegetation plots from habitats across the globe directly contradict this assumption. We find no general tendency for local-scale plant species diversity to decline over the last century, calling into question the widespread use of ecosystem function experiments to argue for the importance of biodiversity conservation in nature.           ,              Global biodiversity is in decline. This is of concern for aesthetic and ethical reasons, but possibly also for practical reasons, as suggested by experimental studies, mostly with plants, showing that biodiversity reductions in small study plots can lead to compromised ecosystem function. However, inferring that ecosystem functions will decline due to biodiversity loss in the real world rests on the untested assumption that such loss is actually occurring at these small scales in nature. Using a global database of 168 published studies and {$>$}16,000 nonexperimental, local-scale vegetation plots, we show that mean temporal change in species diversity over periods of 5\textendash 261 y is not different from zero, with increases at least as likely as declines over time. Sites influenced primarily by plant species' invasions showed a tendency for declines in species richness, whereas sites undergoing postdisturbance succession showed increases in richness over time. Other distinctions among studies had little influence on temporal richness trends. Although maximizing diversity is likely important for maintaining ecosystem function in intensely managed systems such as restored grasslands or tree plantations, the clear lack of any general tendency for plant biodiversity to decline at small scales in nature directly contradicts the key assumption linking experimental results to ecosystem function as a motivation for biodiversity conservation in nature. How often real world changes in the diversity and composition of plant communities at the local scale cause ecosystem function to deteriorate, or actually to improve, remains unknown and is in critical need of further study.},

  abstract = {The Department of Conservation has implemented a Biodiversity and Monitoring Reporting System (BMRS) that estimates occupancy rates and relative abundances of introduced brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) at a representative sample of sites on public conservation land. Leg-hold traps have been used to monitor possums in the BMRS, but wax tags and chew cards have logistical and financial advantages over traps. If possum occupancy rate and/or abundance index estimates differ depending on which of the three methods are used, then correction of the estimates would be required for valid comparisons. We sampled possum occupancy rates and relative abundances using leg-hold traps, wax tags and chew cards in the BMRS sampling design at each of 54 forest and 54 non-forest sites. Possum occupancy rates estimated using each of the three detection methods were similar and hence do not require correction. Median possum abundance index values estimated from traps were lower than those estimated from wax tags and chew cards in forest, but were similar to those from wax tags in non-forest. Calibration is therefore required if possum abundance index values from either chew cards or wax tags are to be validly compared with trap catch abundance index values. We used a zeroinflated negative binomial (ZINB) model to calibrate the chew card and wax tag abundance indices with the trap catch abundance index. The ZINB model allowed us to account for structural zeros (i.e. possums were not present and therefore cannot be detected) and non-structural zeros (i.e. possums were present, but not detected by a particular method). The relationship between possum abundance index estimates from chew cards and leg-hold traps was better calibrated than that between wax tags and leg-hold traps, with the latter particularly poor in non-forest habitat. We therefore conclude that chew cards, rather than wax tags, should replace leg-hold traps for monitoring possum occupancy rates and relative abundances in the BMRS. Our ZINB model can be used to correct chew card abundance index values for valid comparison with previous trap catch abundance index values estimated using the BMRS design.},

The relationship between genotype and adaptive phenotypes is weak because populations are often difficult to quantify and experiments are logistically challenging or unfeasible. Interestingly, in freshwater fish, studies to characterize the genetic architecture of adaptive traits are not as rare as in other vertebrate groups. In this review, we summarize the few cases where the relationship between the ecology and genetics of freshwater fish is more developed, namely the relationship between genetic markers and ecological phenotypes.},

Although a number of modifications have been proposed to increase efficiency, no account has hitherto been made of the possible loss of trapped larvae and juveniles as a result of within-trap predation by piscivorous fish. To address this issue, we evaluated the efficiency of modified light traps by the addition of mesh (3 mm knot-to-knot wrapped around the entrance chambers), by combining results from a longterm monitoring study with those from a designed field experiment. Abundance of larvae and juveniles collected during the monitoring program was higher in the years following mesh application (hence, beyond monthly variation), and this was supported by the experiment. Based on the latter, light/mesh traps consistently caught only larvae/juveniles, hence excluding adults; whereas the opposite was true of the light/no-mesh trap combination. Also, mesh/no-light traps did not capture any fish, unlike nomesh/no-light traps, which sampled only adults. Our findings suggest that in situ predation on larvae and juveniles within light traps should not be overlooked. The occurrence of piscivorous and cannibalistic behaviour in Hypseleotris spp. is also discussed.},

While {$\delta$}13C values of both organic matter sources and consumers varied little between locations, {$\delta$}15N spatial variability was higher and {$\delta$}15N was shown to be a good descriptor of organic enrichment and uptake of anthropogenically derived material within coastal food webs. Isotopic data were analysed using a multivariate approach. Organic matter sources and benthic components were more sensitive to pollution than nektobenthic species and revealed that the effects of anthropogenic activities seem to be detectable over a wide area.

In the context of the Pacific herring fishery in British Columbia, Canada, this research explores the strategies and tools used by three Indigenous coastal nations to apply pressure on the colonial government to abdicate its asserted authority over herring governance. Motivated by a time-honored relationship to herring, we discuss how these Indigenous nations have strategized to try to regain authority over herring governance to protect species and Indigenous access to the fishery.

Although the importance of predator (e.g., foraging strategy) and resource characteristics (e.g., quantity) in these indirect interactions is well recognized, little attention has been paid to prey characteristics (e.g., density), especially in field studies. We focused on a marine trophic cascade involving the carnivorous snail Thais clavigera, its limpet prey Siphonaria sirius, and the algae Lithoderma sp. and Ulva sp. Using intertidal rocks as natural replicates, we experimentally evaluated the in situ effects of the DMIIs and TMIIs on the algal community under two density ranges of prey. The strengths of consumptive effects (CEs) and non-consumptive effects (NCEs) of the predator on the prey limpet were also monitored to elucidate the mechanisms of the indirect interactions. At high densities, CEs decreased the percentage of individual limpets that disappeared (that likely died); however, neither DMIIs nor TMIIs were detected. At low densities, both CEs and NCEs reduced the per capita feeding rate and CEs reduced the growth rate of limpets. Moreover, Lithoderma sp. was replaced by Ulva sp. through both DMIIs and TMIIs. These results suggest that prey density is a key determinant of the strengths of CEs and NCEs, and notably, of DMIIs and TMIIs.},

Manipulating such inherently multiple-table data using several data frames can result in long and difficult-to-read workflows. We introduce the R multitable package to provide new data storage objects called data.list objects, which extend the data.frame concept to explicitly multiple-table settings. Like data frames, data lists are lists of variables stored as vectors; what is new is that these vectors have dimension attributes that make accessing and manipulating them easier. As data.list objects can be coerced to data.frame objects, they can be used with all R functions that accept an object that is coercible to a data.frame.},

  abstract = {The practice of supporting weak wild populations by capturing a fraction of the wild individuals, bringing them into captivity for reproduction, and releasing their offspring into the natural habitat to mix with wild ones is called supportive breeding and has been widely applied in thefields of conservation biology and fish and wildlife management. Thisprocedure is intended to increase population size without introducing exogenous genes into the managed population. Previous work examining the genetic effects of a single generation of supportive breeding has shown that although a successful program increases the census population size, it may reduce the genetically effective population size and thereby induce excessive inbreeding and loss of genetic variation. We expand and generalize previous analyses of supportive breeding and consider the effects of multiple generations of supportive breeding on rates of inbreeding and genetic drift. We derived recurrence equations for the inbreeding coefficient and coancestry, and thereby equations for inbreeding and variance effective sizes, under three models for selecting captive breeders: at random, preferentially among those born in captivity, and preferentially among those born in the wild. Numerical examples indicate that supportive breeding, when carried out successfully over multiple generations, may increase not only the census but also the effective size of the supported population as a whole. If supportive breeding does not result in a substantial and continuous increase of the census size of the breeding population, however, it might be genetically harmful because of elevated rates of inbreeding and genetic drift.},

Efforts to mitigate severe losses to many wild stocks caused by overfishing, destruction of habitat, and blockage of migratory routes have focussed on boosting artificial production in public hatcheries. Opportunities for genetic interactions between hatchery and wild fish will increase if efforts to supplement wild production with hatchery-reared fish continue. Concerns center on three issues: (1) direct genetic effects (caused by hybridization and introgression); (2) indirect genetic effects (principally due to altered selection regimes or reductions in population size caused by competition, predation, disease, or other factors); and (3) genetic changes to hatchery stocks (through selection, drift, or stock transfers), which magnify the consequences of hybridization with wild fish. Strategies for minimizing these genetic risks and monitoring the consequences of various management options are discussed, and some important areas for future research are identified.},

How and to what extent these societies impacted their landscape through deforestation and forest management is still controversial, particularly in the vast interfluvial uplands that have been little studied. In Brazil, the groundbreaking discovery of hundreds of geometric earthworks by modern deforestation would seem to imply that this region was also deforested to a large extent in the past, challenging the apparent vulnerability of Amazonian forests to human land use. We reconstructed environmental evidence from the geoglyph region and found that earthworks were built within man-made forests that had been previously managed for millennia. In contrast, long-term, regional-scale deforestation is strictly a modern phenomenon.           ,                             Over 450 pre-Columbian (pre-AD 1492) geometric ditched enclosures (``geoglyphs'') occupy {$\sim$}13,000 km               2               of Acre state, Brazil, representing a key discovery of Amazonian archaeology. These huge earthworks were concealed for centuries under               terra firme               (upland interfluvial) rainforest, directly challenging the ``pristine'' status of this ecosystem and its perceived vulnerability to human impacts. We reconstruct the environmental context of geoglyph construction and the nature, extent, and legacy of associated human impacts. We show that bamboo forest dominated the region for {$\geq$}6,000 y and that only small, temporary clearings were made to build the geoglyphs; however, construction occurred within anthropogenic forest that had been actively managed for millennia. In the absence of widespread deforestation, exploitation of forest products shaped a largely forested landscape that survived intact until the late 20th century.},

Stereo BRUVs also recorded a greater number of largebodied targeted species in higher abundance than stereo DOV (e.g. Lethrinus nebulosus, Plectropomus leopardus) at the Houtman Abrolhos and at Ningaloo Reef. Many nontargeted species were also recorded in greater abundances on stereo BRUV than stereo DOV (e.g. Coris auricularis, Gymnothorax spp). Stereo DOV transects recorded a greater abundance of some small-bodied Pomacentridae, Labridae and Scaridae species than did stereo BRUV, particularly at Ningaloo Reef.

  abstract = {Studies have demonstrated ways in which climate-related shifts in the distributions and relative abundances of marine species are expected to alter the dynamics and catch potential of global fisheries. While these studies assess impacts on large-scale commercial fisheries, few efforts have been made to quantitatively project impacts on small-scale subsistence and commercial fisheries that are economically, socially and culturally important to many coastal communities. This study uses a dynamic bioclimate envelope model to project scenarios of climate-related changes in the relative abundance, distribution and richness of 98 exploited marine fishes and invertebrates of commercial and cultural importance to First Nations in coastal British Columbia, Canada. Declines in abundance are projected for most of the sampled species under both the lower (Representative Concentration Pathway [RCP] 2.6) and higher (RCP 8.5) emission scenarios (-15.0\% to -20.8\%, respectively), with poleward range shifts occurring at a median rate of 10.3 to 18.0 km decade-1 by 2050 relative to 2000. While a cumulative decline in catch potential is projected coastwide (-4.5 to -10.7\%), estimates suggest a strong positive correlation between the change in relative catch potential and latitude, with First Nations' territories along the northern and central coasts of British Columbia likely to experience less severe declines than those to the south. Furthermore, a strong negative correlation is projected between latitude and the number of species exhibiting declining abundance. These trends are shown to be robust to alternative species distribution models. This study concludes by discussing corresponding management challenges that are likely to be encountered under climate change, and by highlighting the value of joint-management frameworks and traditional fisheries management approaches that could aid in offsetting impacts and developing sitespecific mitigation and adaptation strategies derived from local fishers' knowledge.},

The present paper describes how the aquaculture waste model DEPOMOD (Cromey, C.J., Nickell, T.D., Black, K.D. 2002a. DEPOMOD \textemdash modelling the deposition and biological effects of waste solids from marine cage farms. Aquaculture 214, 211\textendash 239.), originally developed for finfish aquaculture sites, was adapted and validated for suspended shellfish aquaculture. Field data were collected for species-specific model input parameters (mussel biodeposition rates and particle settling velocities) and several finfish model parameters (farm representation and calculation of aquaculture wastes) were adjusted for the shellfish scenario. Shellfish-DEPOMOD was tested at three coastal mussel Mytilus edulis farms with differing hydrodynamic regimes in Quebec, Canada. For each site, model predictions were compared to observed deposition measured in situ with sediment traps. Sedimentation rates under the three mussel culture sites were ca. two to five times those observed at corresponding reference sites. Mussel biodeposits were predicted to accumulate within 30 m of the farms in the shallow depositional sites while being dispersed more than 90 m in the deeper dispersive site. At the farm site in Great-Entry Lagoon, model predictions agreed well with field data for the 0+ and 1+ mussel cohorts when the maximum biodeposit production parameter was used. At the farm site in House-Harbour Lagoon, model predictions did not agree with observed sedimentation rates, due most likely to the resuspension and advection of non farm-derived material and complex hydrodynamics. The model correctly predicted the pattern of waste dispersal at the third farm site in Cascapedia Bay, although it underestimated biodeposition. Predicted fluxes may have been underestimated at this site because biodeposits from biofouling communities were not included in the calculation of aquaculture wastes. The relationship between modelled long-term biodeposition and benthic descriptors was assessed for the three farms. Alterations to the benthic community were observed at high biodeposition rates (N 15 g m- 2 d- 1). At the most disturbed site, predicted fluxes were best correlated with the Infaunal Trophic Index (ITI) (R = -0.79, P b 0.001), followed by AZTI's marine disturbance index (AMBI) (R = 0.64, P b 0.001). The potential application of Shellfish-DEPOMOD in terms of the management of shellfish aquaculture sites is discussed.},

Bacteria contributed about 24\% to the phytoplankton\textendash bacteria carbon biomass in the most ultraoligotrophic lakes, and their relative contribution declined to {$<$}11\% with increasing lake productivity. At increasingly high nutrient loadings to the lakes, bacteria abundance increased and was closely correlated with phytoplankton biomass and productivity. Heterotrophic nanoflagellate (HNF) abundance was positively correlated with bacterial numbers. Grazing experiments revealed that HNF were the primary pathway for moving bacterial production to higher trophic levels in oligotrophic British Columbia lakes, and predation by the ciliate and rotifer microzooplankton community appeared to exert top-down control over the abundance of HNF and the transfer of carbon from bacteria. The HNF and microzooplankton, in turn, were affected by the abundance of crustacean mesozooplankton, principally copepods in our experiments.},

  abstract = {High-resolution topographic surveying is traditionally associated with high capital and logistical costs, so that data acquisition is often passed on to specialist third party organisations. The high costs of data collection are, for many applications in the earth sciences, exacerbated by the remoteness and inaccessibility of many field sites, rendering cheaper, more portable surveying platforms (i.e. terrestrial laser scanning or GPS) impractical. This paper outlines a revolutionary, low-cost, user-friendly photogrammetric technique for obtaining high-resolution datasets at a range of scales, termed `Structure-from-Motion' (SfM). Traditional softcopy photogrammetric methods require the 3-D location and pose of the camera(s), or the 3-D location of ground control points to be known to facilitate scene triangulation and reconstruction. In contrast, the SfM method solves the camera pose and scene geometry simultaneously and automatically, using a highly redundant bundle adjustment based on matching features in multiple overlapping, offset images. A comprehensive introduction to the technique is presented, followed by an outline of the methods used to create high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) from extensive photosets obtained using a consumer-grade digital camera. As an initial appraisal of the technique, an SfM-derived DEM is compared directly with a similar model obtained using terrestrial laser scanning. This intercomparison reveals that decimetre-scale vertical accuracy can be achieved using SfM even for sites with complex topography and a range of land-covers. Example applications of SfM are presented for three contrasting landforms across a range of scales including; an exposed rocky coastal cliff; a breached moraine-dam complex; and a glacially-sculpted bedrock ridge. The SfM technique represents a major advancement in the field of photogrammetry for geoscience applications. Our results and experiences indicate SfM is an inexpensive, effective, and flexible approach to capturing complex topography.},

  abstract = {Two of the best-supported theories which describe the effects of disturbance within marine benthic habitats are the organic enrichment `Successional Model' and the `Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis'. Underlying these models, biological mechanisms thought to drive community change include competition, facilitation, inhibition, tolerance and random colonisation. To further examine the effects of disturbance an experimental test of the effects of different types (burial, raking and organic enrichment) and intensities of disturbance on infaunal intertidal communities at two different sites with similar suites of species was carried out. The same type and frequency of disturbance, applied to the two different sites, produced different responses at the species, community and trophic group level. In models that assume a linear relationship between disturbance intensity and effect, knowledge of the intensity of any novel disturbance, combined with the original disturbance regime experienced by a community (i.e. its `starting point'), should be sufficient to predict final community characteristics. The current results do not conform to such a linear interpretation, as at both sites the intensity of treatments did not always predict the degree of disturbance. Therefore the response to disturbance may depend on site-specific factors such as the history of prior disturbance and the inherent ecological plasticity exhibited by many benthic species. Whilst current models perform well in predicting benthic responses to gross disturbance, detecting subtler effects requires a recognition that community response may depend on the site, the species and the sources of disturbance.},

Drawing on lessons from Indigenous knowledge systems in what is now called British Columbia, Canada, we demonstrate how place-based values directed the stewardship of historical oak-meadow and clam gardens, which created diverse and productive ecosystems that sustained for millennia.  Drawing on examples of contemporary restoration projects (crabapple orchards and clam gardens) that utilize place-based values to inform the recovery of ecocultural landscapes, we propose a framework to help initiate a place-based values approach in contemporary restoration design congruent with ethics of inclusion.},

  abstract = {Humanity's ambitions to revive ecosystems at large scales require solutions to move restoration efforts beyond the small scale. There are increasing calls for technological solutions to reduce costs and facilitate large-scale restoration through the use of emerging technologies using an adaptive process of research and development. We show how technological enrichment of marine soundscapes may provide a solution that repairs the recruitment process to accelerate the recovery of lost marine habitats. This solution would solve the problems of current practice that largely relies upon natural recruitment processes, which carries considerable risk where recruitment is variable or eroded. By combining the literature with laboratory experiments, we describe evidence for ``highways of sound'' that convey navigable information for dispersing life stages in search for adult habitat. We show that these navigational cues tend to be silenced as their habitat is lost, creating negative feedbacks that hinders restoration. We suggest that reprovisioning soundscapes using underwater technology offers the potential to reverse this feedback and entice target organisms to recruit in greater densities. Collective evidence indicates that the application of soundscape theory and technology may unlock the recruitment potential needed to trigger the recruitment of target organisms and the natural soundscapes they create at large scales.},

  abstract = {Ethnobiology is increasingly recognized from within and outside of its boundaries as interdisciplinary. The Society of Ethnobiology defines the field as ``the scientific study of dynamic relationships among peoples, biota, and environments.'' Ethnobiologists are able to skillfully assess challenges of biocultural conservation across the divides of political ecology. They are situated to mediate between conservation programs that target biodiversity preservation with little concern for the needs of human communities, and those (such as the New Conservation movement) that privilege those needs. Ethnobiology also transcends the pervasive assumption in these fields that Western knowledge and economic goals should guide change. Because of ethnobiology's importance as a bridging discipline, it is important to ask what unifies ethnobiology. Is it common subject matter? Or, is there an underlying emphasis representing an ``ethnobiological perspective?'' Answers to these questions are explored here using content analysis and discourse-and-ideology analysis. We use the results to identify the unique roles ethnobiologists play in biocultural conservation. This analysis also proved useful in the systematic identification of four salient themes that unify ethnobiology\textemdash ethics in ethnobiology, shared environmental and cultural heritage, interdisciplinary science and non-science, and ecological understanding. How ethnobiologists conceive of themselves is critical for further enrichment of the field as interdisciplinary human-environmental scholarship, particularly in reference to biocultural conservation. Self-definition makes explicit the unique strengths of the field, which by its very nature integrates a sophisticated understanding of political ecology with appreciation of the value of traditional ecological knowledge (TEK), social science, and the biological sciences.},

This paper draws on results obtained from a 3-year study to reveal the connection between Indigenous socio-economic values and river flows in the Daly River, Northern Territory. Qualitative phenological knowledge was analysed and compared to quantitative resource-use data, obtained through a large household survey of Indigenous harvesting and fishing effort. A more complete picture of Indigenous resourceuse and management strategies was found to be provided by the adoption of mixed methods. The quantitative data revealed resource-use patterns including when and where species are harvested. The qualitative Indigenous ecological data validated results from the quantitative surveys and provided insights into harvesting and resource management strategies not revealed by the discrete time-bound surveys. As such, it informed the scientific understanding of patterns of resource use and relationships between people, subsistence use and river flows in the Daly River catchment. We recommend that natural resource managers, researchers and Indigenous experts prioritise collaborative projects that record Indigenous knowledge to improve water managers' understanding of Indigenous customary aquatic resource use.},

We analyzed local experiments, long-term regional time series, and global fisheries data to test how biodiversity loss affects marine ecosystem services across temporal and spatial scales. Overall, rates of resource collapse increased and recovery potential, stability, and water quality decreased exponentially with declining diversity. Restoration of biodiversity, in contrast, increased productivity fourfold and decreased variability by 21\%, on average. We conclude that marine biodiversity loss is increasingly impairing the ocean's capacity to provide food, maintain water quality, and recover from perturbations. Yet available data suggest that at this point, these trends are still reversible.},

Leaf samples from Avicennia marina (grey mangrove) were used to compare the nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) concentrations, and d15N values in the receiving waters of the adjacent creeks and a set of reference sites established in a neighbouring creek. The same indicators were also measured in macroalgae from the nutrient extraction ponds. The mangrove leaves in the Mixing Zone of the receiving creek were slightly elevated in N concentrations (22 mg g\`A1 compared to 17.5 mg g\`A1 at the Reference sites) and d15N values (6.5 compared to 4.5 at the Reference sites) showing there was an influence from the outputs of the aquaculture fishery. However, P concentrations were the same in the Mixing Zone and Reference sites. Downstream of the Mixing Zone, the concentration of N and P, and the d15N values in the Receiving Waters were the same as the Reference sites, at levels considered normal in other studies. These results show that aquaculture fisheries can be managed to maintain nutrients at reference levels in mangrove foliage in estuaries of the receiving zones.},

Since individual covariates are only observable for captured individuals, complex conditional likelihood methods are usually required and these do not constitute a standard generalized linear model (GLM) family. Modern statistical techniques such as generalized additive models (GAMs), which allow a relaxing of the linearity assumptions on the covariates, are readily available for many standard GLM families. Fortunately, a natural statistical framework for maximizing conditional likelihoods is available in the Vector GLM and Vector GAM classes of models. We present several new R-functions (implemented within the VGAM package) specifically developed to allow the incorporation of individual covariates in the analysis of closed population CR data using a GLM/GAM-like approach and the conditional likelihood. As a result, a wide variety of practical tools are now readily available in the VGAM object oriented framework. We discuss and demonstrate their advantages, features and flexibility using the new VGAM CR functions on several examples.},

  abstract = {We quantified the distribution, abundance, biomass and assemblage structure of benthic macrofauna at different spatio-temporal scales in a temperate estuarine, intertidal soft-sediment environment in the Schelde estuary, The Netherlands. Hierarchically scaled surveys were conducted yearly between 1994 and 2000, covering 4 spatial scales: region (104 m), transect (103 m), station (102 m), and replicate samples (10\textendash 1 m). Our approach provided a powerful framework for quantifying the proportion of the variation among samples that was attributable to each spatial or temporal scale, and we explicitly aimed at identifying the role of environmental variables in explaining the observed variability. Variance components calculated for 11 dominant macrobenthic species revealed that variations at the scale of stations and year \texttimes{} station interactions were the most important components of variability. Regional and transect differences were only apparent for a few species, although multivariate analysis revealed clear inter-regional differences for the macrobenthic assemblage structure. Only a few species displayed significant variability associated with the factor year solely. Both spatial and temporal components explained {$>$} 70\% of the total variance. A substantial part of the total variation in abundance of individual species was explained by the observed environmental variables (27 to 56\%). Multiple regression with subdivision of the environmental variables into a long-term average and a temporal component showed that the long-term averages were much more important than the short-term deviations from this average, with local environmental variables (mud content, chlorophyll a, bed level height) explaining the largest part of the observed variation. For a few species and total biomass, salinity also explained a large part of the observed variation. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) with forward selection revealed that salinity and mud content, and to a lesser extent chlorophyll a and bed-level height, accounted for most of the variance in the macrobenthic species data. Partial CCA indicated that of the variation in the species data a large part was spatially structured (56.7\%), with about half of this variation being explained by the environmental variables used. Only 4.1\% of the species variation was temporally structured. Our results have important consequences for both the interpretation of monitoring programmes and the enhancement of sampling designs.},

An outdoor freshwater mesocosm experiment was used to determine how warming of \$4 1C would affect the size, biomass and taxonomic structure of planktonic communities. Warming increased the steepness of the community size spectrum by increasing the prevalence of small organisms, primarily within the phytoplankton assemblage and it also reduced the mean and maximum size of phytoplankton by approximately one order of magnitude. The observed shifts in phytoplankton size structure were reflected in changes in phytoplankton community composition, though zooplankton taxonomic composition was unaffected by warming. Furthermore, warming reduced community biomass and total phytoplankton biomass, although zooplankton biomass was unaffected. This resulted in an increase in the zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass ratio in the warmed mesocosms, which could be explained by faster turnover within the phytoplankton assemblages. Overall, warming shifted the distribution of phytoplankton size towards smaller individuals with rapid turnover and low standing biomass, resulting in a reorganization of the biomass structure of the food webs. These results indicate future environmental warming may have profound effects on the structure and functioning of aquatic communities and ecosystems.},

  abstract = {This introduction to the R package Formula is a (slightly) modified version of Zeileis and Croissant (2010), published in the Journal of Statistical Software. Model formulas are the standard approach for specifying the variables in statistical models in the S language. Although being eminently useful in an extremely wide class of applications, they have certain limitations including being confined to single responses and not providing convenient support for processing formulas with multiple parts. The latter is relevant for models with two or more sets of variables, e.g., different equations for different model parameters (such as mean and dispersion), regressors and instruments in instrumental variable regressions, two-part models such as hurdle models, or alternative-specific and individual-specific variables in choice models among many others. The R package Formula addresses these two problems by providing a new class ``Formula'' (inheriting from ``formula'') that accepts an additional formula operator | separating multiple parts and by allowing all formula operators (including the new |) on the left-hand side to support multiple responses.},

  abstract = {A previous version to this introduction to the R package zoo has been published as Zeileis and Grothendieck (2005) in the Journal of Statistical Software. zoo is an R package providing an S3 class with methods for indexed totally ordered observations, such as discrete irregular time series. Its key design goals are independence of a particular index/time/date class and consistency with base R and the "ts" class for regular time series. This paper describes how these are achieved within zoo and provides several illustrations of the available methods for "zoo" objects which include plotting, merging and binding, several mathematical operations, extracting and replacing data and index, coercion and NA handling. A subclass "zooreg" embeds regular time series into the "zoo" framework and thus bridges the gap between regular and irregular time series classes in R.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a brief history of two different methods for studying the species population structure. The first method employs ecological markers that characterize population-specific environmental conditions, as well as biological features of populations. The second one involves genetic markers: DNA and RNA fragments, allozymes, etc. The problem of combining these two methods is discussed. A two-step approach is suggested for studying the species population structure using both the ecological and genetic markers. Firstly, the studied part of the species range is subdivided into so-called ecogeographic units (EGUs) according to environmental gradients, life strategies, and other characteristics that presumably associate with adaptation gradients and interpopulation gene flows. Secondly, the EGUs are tested genetically by using the data on multiple population samples that represent population segments within each of the ecogeographic units. The notion of representative samples with respect to the population structure, hierarchy of EGUs\textendash populations, strategies of population management, and selection of the management units for optimizing exploitation, reproduction, and conservation of species fragments are discussed on the basis of this approach.},

  abstract = {Food chain length (FCL) represents a fundamental metric within ecology because it has implications for ecosystem function and responses to environmental change. Omnivory between linked food chains situated within large ecosystems can increase FCL, whereas overlap of food chains within small or spatially compressed ecosystems is generally thought to decrease FCL. Yet FCL varies widely in small ecosystems and the mechanisms underlying determinants of FCL in these systems is unclear. In small shallow lakes, littoral structure is a predictor of FCL but it is unclear whether this is due to productivity or refuge mechanisms. Here we provide evidence, using consumer resource food web modules parameterized with empirical data, that refuge in spatially compressed ecosystems has the ability on its own to increase the trophic position of top predators by increasing the biomass of top and intermediate predators across a range of common food web module structures. Our results suggest that refuge is an important driver of FCL in small ecosystems, which has implications for determining responses of these systems to environmental change.},

  abstract = {We examined how the trophic ecology of nine economically important marine taxa varied across three distinct areas of the Adriatic Sea. These taxa included three species of demersal fishes (European hake Merluccius merluccius, red mullet Mullus barbatus, black-bellied angler Lophius budegassa) and two species of decapod crustaceans (Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus, deep-water rose shrimp Parapenaeus longirostris) and four species of pelagic fishes (sardine Sardina pilchardus, anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus, Mediterranean horse mackerel Trachurus mediterraneus, Atlantic horse mackerel Trachurus trachurus). We used two complementary methods that differed in their temporal context to examine and compare diet. Stomach contents analysis was used to describe the short term diet while stable isotope analysis was used compare long-term assimilated diet. Results showed that although there were spatial differences in what each species consumed, and in their trophic and isotopic niches, each species fed at similar trophic position across locations, indicating similar ecological function. Comparisons of biomass-weighted trophic position ({$\delta$}15N) and consumer body size (log2 mass) showed evidence for a common isotopic size spectrum across areas, indicating the existence of a size-structured food web. In turn this allowed us to provide a first estimate of the predator\textendash prey body mass ratio (PPMR) for this area (655:1). Results obtained within this study, in future, could be used for ecological modeling and improved long-term management of the Adriatic Sea's marine resources.},

  abstract = {This book provides a practical introduction to analysing ecological data using real data sets collected as part of postgraduate ecological studies or research projects. The first part of the book gives a largely non-mathematical introduction to data exploration, univariate methods (including GAM and mixed modelling techniques), multivariate analysis, time series analysis (e.g. common trends) and spatial statistics. The second part provides 17 case studies, mainly written together with biologists who attended courses given by the first authors. The case studies include topics ranging from terrestrial ecology to marine biology. The case studies can be used as a template for your own data analysis; just try to find a case study that matches your own ecological questions and data structure, and use this as starting point for you own analysis. Data from all case studies are available from www.highstat.com. Guidance on software is provided in Chapter 2. Alain Zuur is senior statistician and director of Highland Statistics Ltd., a statistical consultancy company based in the UK. He has contributed to a wide range of projects related to marine biology, oceanography, ecology, fisheries, etc. and has extensive experience teaching statistics to ecologists and environmental scientists in the form of academic and non-academic courses.

  abstract = {Background: The aim of the research was to study the gastropod assemblage associated with a planted mangrove consisting of Rhizophora apiculata in Dam Bay (Tre Island, Nha Trang Bay, central Vietnam). Long-term changes in species composition, density, and biomass of gastropod assemblages in a planted mangrove were compared to those associated with natural mangroves. Results: The gastropod assemblages in one planted and two natural mangrove associations were studied. Long-term monitoring (2005 to 2013) of assemblages associated with planted mangroves was also carried out. In total, 53 gastropod species in 21 families were recorded. This is comparable or even higher than in other areas of South-East Asia. In planted mangroves, R. apiculata trees were planted in mid (in 2004) and lower (2007) intertidal zones. Composition of gastropod fauna during the early period of observations (2005 to 2006) differed significantly in species richness, biomass, and abundance from the later period (2008 to 2013). Initially, the values of these parameters were low in the upper, and mid-intertidal zones and negligible in low intertidal zone. In 2008 to 2013, the values increased in the upper and mid-intertidal zones. R. apiculata planting in mid-intertidal zone and changes in its gastropod assemblage strongly affected those of upper intertidal zone as well. Comparison of gastropod fauna in planted mangroves and natural associations revealed significant differences. In planted mangroves, gastropods were mostly represented by eurybiotic species, also found in other not mangrove intertidal habitats, while in natural association many species were predominantly mangrove inhabitants, e.g., Potamididae, Littorinidae, and Ellobiidae. The fact that mangrove plantations in Dam Bay are highly dominated by opportunistic species, together with a paucity of predominantly mangrove-associated gastropods, suggest that the whole ecosystem is not balanced yet. Conclusions: The gastropod assemblage found in a 9-year old mangrove plantation differed from natural mangrove associations in that the former is dominated by opportunistic eurybiotic gastropod species. This could mean that the ecosystem of planted mangroves is unbalanced and is still in a transitional state.},
