How I deal with task management. 

These are just bullet points like 
```
- [ ]
```
- [x] give the [[Zotero]] tutorial ðŸ“… 2023-01-19 âœ… 2023-01-23
- [x] Install [[Zotero]] ðŸ“… 2023-01-17 âœ… 2023-01-23

With a recent update, you can now put custom symbols inside the `[ ]`, such as :

- [i] for an idea
- [?] for a question 

The key is that you can place these in any note, and then make a code block to show all the relevant tasks here.

```tasks
not done
```

> [!info] 
> For an example, make a daily note by clicking on the calendar to see my template
