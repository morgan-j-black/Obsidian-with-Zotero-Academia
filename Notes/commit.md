## Commit

This is when the files are fully incorporated into the [[git history]]. If you mess this up it can be tricky to fix, look in [[git revert]] and [[git reset]].

To [[commit]], type 
```shell
git commit -m "[commit message]"
```

The message will appear when you are looking through the [[git history]], so try and make it useful. If you use [[Obsidian git plugin]], then the commit message will default to the date and time.

> Now you can [[push]] the files to [[GitHub]]
