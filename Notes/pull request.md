> A way to contribute to [[open source]] code by requesting that the owner of a [[Github repo]] [[pull]]s in your changes

There are a few steps to this which don’t really make much sense until you try and do it yourself.

1. [[fork]] the [[Github repo]] so it appears with your account name first
2. Create a new [[Branch]] on this [[fork]]. This is important as it separates your changes from any that might happen upstream
3. Make your changes on this branch 
4. When you are happy with them [[push]] them to your [[fork]]
5. [[GitHub]] should now prompt you to open a [[pull request]]. You need to write a description of the changes so the owner know whether they want to accept the changes
6. At this point the owner has probably set up some [[tests]] to make sure your changes don’t break everything - even if they get pass the tests the owner can still request that you change a few things before they accept
7. Congratulations! The owner accepted your changes, you can now delete your branch if you want as it’s job is over
