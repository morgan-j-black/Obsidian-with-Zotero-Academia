## Merge

If your local copy and the cloud don’t agree they will have a [[merge conflict]], meaning that [[git]] doesn’t know how to put the files back together.

Therefore, it will ask you to manually [[merge]] the changes yourself and then [[commit]] them when you are finished. 

> [!warning]
> This is where some people get stuck and then just delete the whole folder. I’ve done this several times…

Try following the instructions in [[merge conflict]], or use the official [[GitHub]] to see a visual representation.
