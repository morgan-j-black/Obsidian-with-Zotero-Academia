How I get citations from [[Zotero]]. There is another plugin, but this one is simpler as it just looks for a library.bib file.

> How you update this `.bib` file will be covered in [[Zotero - Better Bibtex]].

Oh, how did this citation get here... [[@Laker2021a]]

# Setting up

This [[Obsidian - Plugins|plugin]] is just looking for a `.bib` file. You can create this, and have it automatically update with [[Zotero - Better Bibtex]].

Once you have saved you `.bib` in the vault, just go to [[Obsidian - Citations]] settings and update the name.

> [!warning] 
> Make sure format is `BibLateX`

# Creating literature notes

If you open/create literature notes with this plugin, everthing will be handled automatically. 

To open a literature note type `ctrl+shift+o`, which should open the citation browser like this ![[Pasted image 20230129100050.png]]

Now you can search for your items and press enter.

You should now see the file has been created in the `Literature Notes` folder (you can change the location in the settings)

You can also use `ctrl+shift+c` to insert the [[Obsidian - wiki link|link]] here **and** create the file. From then on, you can just use them like normal [[Obsidian - wiki link]], but with an "@" at the front to distinguish the notes. They will be kept in `Literature Notes/`

# Templates

I have included my template in the [[Obsidian - Citations]] settings, which gives a link to the [[Zotero]] item (won't work for you as this is my `.bib` file) and the original doi.
