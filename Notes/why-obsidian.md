# Where I started and why

I came to find and use Obsidian after a deep dive to fins a solution to an issue that had been plaguing me for years in my doctoral research;  keeping track of all the the things.  Years of reading, research, and idea generation had created a mountain of potentially useful content. However, I was at a loss for a system to find and use any of it efficiently.  An inability to synthesize this information to write stalled to the point of paralysis.  I tried many approaches and apps;  notebooks and journals, elaborate color schemes, walls of Post-its, Evernote, Scrivener, Notion, annotations and notes in Zotero, a master Excel file, and master Word documents.  All these approaches came highly recommended, but none were efficient, no flexible, enough for the way I operate.

# Why Obsidian?

Several people in the digital community that raved about Obsidian, as I am now, said that I needed to commit to it for a 3 to 4 weeks to be sure if it could work or not.  This was great advice.  It takes some time to develop a workflow that suites you.  Obsidian's flexibility, and host of very helpful community plug-ins, allow it to do almost anything, so you need to decide what you want it to do for you. 

Here are some of the reasons I love this program...

1. Very flexible, adaptable, and powerful note taking software
	- Personal Knowledge Management System or [[Zettelkasten]]
	- You basically build a personal Wikipedia
2. You do not require a clear structure, outline, or plan in advance - it evolves with you...I think you need to experience this to see just how cool it is
3. Free and open source - so it plays well with many other useful apps like https://www.zotero.org/
4. Lots of great tutorials.  I have found it pretty easy to figure out some complex functionality.
5. Locally stored and 'future proof'
	- Files are stored in a standard file structure and common file format.  You can find, open, and edit files without the program
	- There are ways to make it available across devices, but no one has rights to your stuff!

# What I use Obsidian for

- **My favorite functionality:** Summarizing research articles and other reference material. I have it set up to sync automatically with my Zotero library.  Go here [[how-to-connect-obsidian-to-zotero]] for instructions and resources on how to do that.

- Task management, using a modified "Getting Things Done" approach.  
	- I keep track of everything in Obsidian now and it has reduced my mental clutter/stress tremendously.  I actually relax on the weekends now, because my thoughts are stored and ready for Monday
- Tracking progress, word count, daily thoughts, random ideas
	- Dataview and Templater are two very powerful plugins that can do amazing things
- Managing ongoing areas such as health, family, and home
- Digital drawing, scibbling, mind-mapping with Excalidraw
- Story boarding with Canvas
- Pomodora timer
