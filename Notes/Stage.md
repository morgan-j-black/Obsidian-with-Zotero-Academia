## Stage

Lets say we are working on some files. Once we think we have got them to a good enough level we can [[Stage]] them by typing 
```
git add [filename]
```

or in most cases use this command to add all the currently modified files
```
git add .
```

Once the correct files are staged, we can [[commit]] them to the [[git history]]. 

If you decide you donâ€™t like the changes anymore, you can discard them which will put the files back to the most recent point in the [[git history]].

If you prefer to do this visually, the [[Obsidian git plugin]] should be on the right hand panel. 

> [!warning] 
> If you cannot see it then open [[Obsidian - command palette]] and type "open source control view"

To stage you press the `+` button and the file should be moved to "staged changes"

> Now you can [[commit]] the files
