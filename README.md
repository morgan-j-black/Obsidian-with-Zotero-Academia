# Credit where due:
Full credit to [rlaker](https://github.com/rlaker) / **[Obsidian-for-Academia](https://github.com/rlaker/Obsidian-for-Academia)** for providing the bulk of the foundation of the demo vault for academics.  This vault and tutorial is really well done and I (https://github.com/morgan-j-black) have only adapted, and added to it, based on my experience.  Is worth perusing their Github repository for another perspective.


# Obsidian-for-Academia
Demo vault to explain how to use Obsidian, with an automated link to your Zotero library, to take/make useful notes on the massive literature and/or other reference material you gather in academia.  What do I mean by 'useful?'  Several things:  1. The content is summarized efficiently while incorporating your thoughts and words. These notes can evolve with your thinking. 2. Easy to find (searchable using several fast methods...limiting the frustrating 'where was that reference again?' moments. 3. Linkable so the synthesis of ideas can form organically as your work on a diversity of paragraphs, projects, or interests. 4. 'Future proof', saved locally, and easily read without special software. 5. Works seamlessly with citekeys and cite-while-you-write practices.  This is great for developing ideas, or whole manuscripts (WARNING-rabbit hole), in RMarkdown.

The point of making the tutorial inside Obsidian is to **show**, rather than tell, you how it works. Therefore, this vault comes with some plugins and templates pre-installed.

This hopefully gives you a good base to try out Obsidian and see if you like it.

# Installation

Install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and download this repository.

Inside Obsidian, "open folder as vault" which should open up the start page (Notes/Obsidian). If not then open this file and the tutorial will continue from there.

> To allow third-party plugins, you will need to go into settings and enable community plugins (Settings > Community plugins)

# How it works

Obsidian is a note-taking app, where essentially you are just editing text files with a few extra bells and whistles. The **key** is that you can link notes together with simple wiki link (they look like [[this]]). This allows structure to form as you write down ideas, so you don't need to create a complex folder structure.

By linking these ideas together, structures can naturally form that matches your way of thinking. You also get a cool graph like this:
