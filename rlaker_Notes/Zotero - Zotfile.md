Then as a last resort, you will have to download the `.bib` 

Now, I have to download the pdf separately, find it and import into [[Zotero]].

Or just right click on the citation and "Attach new file", which will attached the most recently downloaded file in a specified folder

> [!tip] 
> I would suggest downloading the `.ris` version of the citation and tell Windows to open these with [[Zotero]] (should do it automatically from then on)

> [!question] 
> Do you have any old citations that don't have pdfs?

Right click and "Find available pdf" which will scour the internet for a pdf. Magic.
