At its simplest [[Obsidian]] is just note taking, but it can become more with plugins. These are written by third-parties (who are usually just enthusiatic [[Obsidian]] users).

I have included the plugins I use most frequently use, which are:
- [[Calendar plugin]]
- [[Obsidian - Citations]]
- [[Clear unused images]]
- [[Excalidraw]]
- [[Quick Latex for Obsidian]]
- [[Media extended]]
- [[Natural Language Dates]]
- [[Obsidian git]]
- [[Tasks]]
- [[Templater]]
