## Push

This **pushes** your local changes to the cloud. There are many different [[cloud services]] you could use, but I will focus on the most popular one: [[GitHub]].

> Before you do this, you need to authenticate your computer so [[GitHub]] knows it is **you** uploading to a [[Github repo]].

So go through the step to [[Github authentication]] first and then come back here.

To push just type 
```shell
git push 
```
